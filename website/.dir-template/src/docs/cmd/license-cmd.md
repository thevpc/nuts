    version 0.5.7.0



 Is a new Open Source Package Manager to help install packages
 and libraries for runtime execution. Nuts is the ultimate companion for
 maven (and other build managers) as it helps installing all package
 dependencies at runtime. Nuts is not tied to java and is a good choice
 to share shell scripts and other 'Things' . It is based on an extensible
 architecture to help supporting a large range of sub managers / repositories.
