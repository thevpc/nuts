=== ```nuts```** stands for **Network Updatable Things Services** tool. It is a simple tool  for managing remote
artifacts, installing these  artifacts to the current machine and executing such  artifacts on need.
Each managed package  is also called a ** `nuts` ** which  is a **Network Updatable Thing Service** .
=== ```nuts```** artifacts are  stored  into repositories. A  **repository**  may be local for  storing local **```nuts```**
or remote for accessing  remote artifacts (good examples  are  remote maven  repositories). It may
also be a proxy repository so that remote artifacts are fetched and cached locally to save network
resources.
One manages a set of repositories called a  workspace. Managed ** `nuts` **  (artifacts)  have descriptorsthat depicts dependencies between them. This dependency is seamlessly handled by  ** `nuts` **  (tool) toresolve and download on-need dependencies over the wire.


=== ```nuts```** is a swiss army knife tool as it acts like (and supports) **maven** build tool to have an abstract
view of the the  artifacts dependency and like  **npm**, **pip** or **zypper/apt-get**  package manager tools  to  install and uninstall artifacts allowing multiple versions of the very same artifact to  be installed.


=== COMMON VERBS:


*  `exec`                : execute an artifact or a command

*  `install` ,  `uninstall`  : install/uninstall an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)

*  `deploy` ,  `undeploy`    : manage artifacts (artifact installers) on the local repositories

*  `update`              : update an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)

*  `fetch` ,  `push`         : download from, upload to remote repositories

*  `search`              : search for existing/installable artifacts

*  `welcome`             : a command that does nothing but bootstrapping ** `nuts` ** and showing a welcome message.

== You'd still be Maven, yet you gonna be Nuts
Is there any package manager for Java(TM) applications? You can google for it and you will find that many have 
queried this on blogs and forums. In most cases responses point to maven and gradle, the tremendous build tools. However, 
both maven and gradle are build tools, while helping build packages they lack of deployment features. They bundle every 
dependency in every package (think of wars, ears and standalone jars). They do not handle installation or upgrading.
Apache ivy, as well, while competing with maven build tool does not provide more than transitive dependency management.   
The main idea behind a package manager is the automation of installation, update, configuration and removal of programs 
or libraries in a coherent manner with the help of a database that manages binaries and metadata. maven, to consider one, 
sticks to the build process, an goes no further.

You may also ask, "Why ever, do we need a package manager for Java(TM) applications". Okkay, let's take some 
example of Java(TM) applications. How can we install apache netbeans IDE ? The proper way is to browse to the editor's 
website, select the proper mirror if applicable, download the archive, uncompress it, chmod the main binary (i'm a linux 
guy) and adjust PATH environment variable to point to this binary; Quite a pain. What do we do to update it now? Hopefully, 
the IDE has a solid plugin architecture and an in-app update/upgrade tool that will help the process (in a gui manner of 
course). The same applies to eclipse and apache tomcat with the exception that apache tomcat does not even bundle an in-app 
update tool. The same applies too when dealing with other operating systems (Windows, MacOS, ...). Managing Java(TM) 
applications is far from helpful.

Furthermore, as Java(TM) applications are (usually) not bundled in OS-aware installers, you will end up with a spaguetty 
home directory with applications installed all over your partitions, which - simply - does not mix up with all the work 
OS-developers have done to separate logs from data, from temporary files, from binaries, etc. Each application will handle 
it's files in a very specific manner that would make it hard to manage own's disk (automatic archive/backup/restore) or roaming
applications across machines, etc.

Moreover, in a world of containers and devops, deployments of Java(TM) applications need to be automatable and reproducible 
with the highest level of simplicity, configurability and integrability. Installing tomcat on a custom port should not not 
be as painful as using a custom Docker image or a complicated Dockerfile or even a custom apache tomcat bundle. 

When we recall that Java(TM) is the one language that has the more versatile number of libraries, frameworks and tools, 
I find it annoying not to have a decent package manager to make the leap and provide facilities I find prime in other 
languages and platforms ( `pip` /python,  `npm` /nodejs/javascript) and most of linux distribution ( `zypper` /opsensuse,  `dnf` /redhat  `apt-get` /debian/ubuntu)
Hence I'm introducing here a humble attempt to provide a tiny (300ko) yet powerful package manager for Java(TM) 
applications (but not only) that should handle jar files seamlessly (with little or no modification) and that comes with 
a set of portable tools that makes this management at a higher level. I'm not talking about redefining the wheel. 
I'm aware that many tools such as maven, are already very good at what they do, I just needed to make the leap for deployments. 
You will be able to deploy your applications without bundling all of their dependencies : ** `nuts` ** will take care of that. 
So you'd still be maven, yet you gonna be ** `nuts` **.  

=== Nuts Package manager

=== ```nuts```** is actually :

* a transitive dependency resolution manager

* package manager (backports maven and supports maven repositories)

* automation tool

* feature rich toolset

* application framework

* decentralized

* sandbox based


==== Transitive dependency resolution manager

=== ```nuts```** calculates transitive dependencies of an application to resolve other packages to download at install or
update/upgrade time. So typically, deployed applications should no more bundle their dependencies within the deployed archive.
Thus we avoid the annoying fat jars (using maven plugins like 'maven-assembly-plugin' and 'maven-shade-plugin') and lib folders 
(using 'maven-dependency-plugin'). It will also reuse dependencies and packages across multiple installed applications 
and hence save disk space, and network bandwidth.

All what ** `nuts` ** needs is a descriptor file withing the jar file that defines the immediate dependencies. It then calculates all transitive dependencies automatically. And guess what, all maven built jars already contain that 
descriptor : the pom.xml file. So basically all maven applications are already ** `nuts` ** aware applications.

==== Package manager

=== ```nuts```** uses this dependency resolution to help install, update, remove and search for applications. To be able to use an
application, it has to be installed and configured with all of its dependencies. This is the main goal of ** `nuts` **.When we ask to install tomcat, for instance, it will search for the best version in registered repositories, download it,
and configure it to be ready for execution. The best version is not always the the latest one. Actually it would be the 
latest valid one, thus the latest one that matches some constraints.  
Constraints include the version of the running java (tomcat 8 works on java 7 but not 6 for instance), the running operating 
system (windows, linux, ... to help selecting the proper binaries), may be the hardware architecture or even the 
operating distribution (for linux based systems). Constraints will filter the search result to include the best, the most 
accurate version to install. Installation also would configure the installed application and even may run another 
artifact to help this configuration.


=== ```nuts```** also handles search for newer versions and update the installed application at request. Updating a software does not
necessarily delete the older version. Both version can coexist and it is up to the user the decide whether or 
not to retain both versions. Indeed, one of the key features of ** `nuts` ** is the ability to install and hence run multiple versions of the same software in parallel. You would never see an error message telling you can't install that software because a 
dependency of it is installed with different version. All software and all libraries can coexist peacefully.

Software artifacts are stored in repositories. ** `nuts` ** can handle multiple repositories, remote and local ones. Installed software are stored in special local repositories. Supported repositories include maven repositories and github 
repositories. Actually a fresh installation of ** `nuts` ** is configured with maven central repository so that, you already have access to thousands of installable artifacts.

At some point, you may need to uninstall an artifact and that's to undo the artifact installation.  
Installation will help you choose between uninstalling binaries only and keeping data/config files or remove permanently 
all of the artifact files. In all ways, uninstalling will not affect other artifacts that use the same dependencies if ever. 
 

==== Feature rich Toolset

=== ```nuts```** is intended to be used either by human users or by robots and other applications. It comes with portable,
feature rich toolset, a versatile library and a handy parsable result. 


=== ```nuts```** is mainly a commandline program that helps installing, uninstalling, searching, updating and running artifacts.
To help desktop integration, ** `nuts` ** installs by default a set of other companion tools such as  `nsh`  (a portable bash-compatible implementation),  `nadmin`  (an administration tool for ** `nuts` ** to configure users, authorizations, repositories, ...) and  `ndi`  (desktop integration) to help creating application shortcuts and scripts;

=== nsh** brings the bash  facilities to all environments (windows included) in a very portable manner. Besides it integrates
well with the installed ** `nuts` ** version. Several common commands are ported to  `nsh`  such as  `cat` , `head` , and  `ssh` , as well as core features like pipes, redirection and scripts. 


=== nadmin** is intended for configuring **```nuts```** workspaces, managing repositories and users. It helps also configuring
sub commands and aliases to make ** `nuts` ** usage even easier.

=== ndi**, is the tool for a seamless integration in your operating system. It mainly configures user PATH variable environment and
creates scripts that point to your ** `nuts` ** installation on linux or MacOS systems. It creates shortcuts to a pre-configured environment on windows.


=== Nuts Workspaces
One of the key features of ** `nuts` ** is the ability to support multiple isolated workspaces, each managing it's own repositories, applications and libraries; each defining it's sandbox security constraints.
Thus non-root installation is made easy while it remains possible to overlap between workspaces by sharing repositories.
Roaming is also supported, so that a workspaces can be copied/moved across machines.


=== Application Framework

=== Nuts** can also be embedded as a library in you application. This enables you to wire classes on the fly by its network
dependency-aware classloading mechanisms. The library allows as well building solid and well integrated applications, 
mainly console applications. Indeed,  `nuts`  comes with rich outputs that support automatic formatting to json, xml, table, tree and plain texts. It handles standard File Systems layouts; XDG Base Directory Specification is implemented 
for linux and MacOS. A compatible one is also implemented in Windows systems. And of course, it helps seamlessly install,
update and remove events. 


=== Nuts ? Really ?
In every palace you will find the wizard and the fool, the ** `maven` ** and the ** `nuts` **; There's no exception in the java kingdom! If you do prefer acronyms here is another reason : ** `nuts` ** stands for Network Updatable Things Services. It should be able to facilitate things deployment and update over the 
wire where things resolve here to any piece of software depending (or not) on other piece of software.


=== Let's start the journey
we start by opening a new terminal (termm, konsole or whatever you prefer) then download ** `nuts` ** using this command : On linux/MacOS system we issue :

[source,]
----
wget https://github.com/thevpc/vpc-public-maven/raw/master/net/vpc/app/nuts/nuts/file-version: unsupported file : /home/vpc/.config/nuts/nuts
Execution Failed with code 2
/nuts-file-version: unsupported file : /home/vpc/.config/nuts/nuts
Execution Failed with code 2
.jar

----

Let's check that java is installed :

[source,]
----
java --version

----

Now we run ** `nuts` **
[source,]
----
java -jar nuts-file-version: unsupported file : /home/vpc/.config/nuts/nuts
Execution Failed with code 2
.jar -zy

----
We used the flags  `-y`  to auto-confirm and  `-z`  to ignore cached binaries (combined here as  `-zy` ). These flags are not required. We use them here to make installation work in all cases.
Installation may last several minutes as it will download all required dependencies, companions and tools.

You should then see this message


[source,]
----
Welcome to nuts. Yeah, it is working...

----


=== ```nuts```** is well installed, just restart your terminal.

Now we will install apache tomcat. So in your terminal type:


[source,]
----
nuts install ntomcat
nuts ntomcat start --set-port 9090

----

The first two commands will install tomcat helper tool (ntomcat) that will download latest version of tomcat and configure it to 9090 port.
The last command will start tomcat.
Let's check tomcat status now

[source,]
----
nuts tomcat status

----

Now we will do the same with derby database. We will install it and run it.

[source,]
----
nuts install nderby
nuts nderby start

----

As you can see, simple commands are all you need to download, install, configure and run tomcat or derby or any application that is deployed in the maven repository.

So please visit  `nuts`  link:https://thevpc.github.com/nuts[website] or link:https://github.com/thevpc/nuts[github repository] for more information.

== Nuts projects

=== ```nuts```** repository is composed of several projects that can be organized in 5 categories

== **Core ```nuts```** : These projects are the core/base of the **```nuts```** package manager

== **Companion Tools** : These projects are applications and tools to install with **```nuts```** itself. Their installation are prompted at first install of **Nuts**

== **Toolbox** : These projects are applications and tools built on top of **```nuts```** Application Framework and are of common interest

== **Lib** : These projects are common libraries that can be used to enabled some **```nuts```** features in your application

== **Other** : All other apps that does no fit in the previous categories

=== 1- Core Nuts projects
Core ** `nuts` ** projects include **nuts-builder**, **nuts-api**, **nuts-core**.
==== 1.1 **nuts-builder**

=== nuts-builder** is a meta project (parent maven pom project) that helps building all the other projects.

==== 1.2 **nuts-api**

=== nuts-api** is the effective "Nuts" only required dependency. It defines the bootstrap application that is responsible of loading all necessary libraries for its execution. **nuts-api** start to load **nuts-core** which is responsible of implementing all features and interfaces declared by the **nuts-api** library. That implementation will handle further download, version dependency etc. Such architecture is considered to force loose coupling with nuts binaries.

=== nuts-api** is a very thin boostrapper : its size is about 300k. It can be used as a standalone application or as an embedded library.

==== 1.3 **nuts-core**

=== nuts-core** is the effective and standard implementation of **nuts-api**. **nuts-core** has a faster update pace than **nuts-api**. It focuses on performance an compliance to the **Nuts** specification declared by **nuts-api** interfaces. You are not required to add this dependency to your application if you want to embed **Nuts**. The library will be loaded on the wire (if not yet present in the classpath).

=== nuts-core** is designed to have very few dependencies : **gson** and **jansi**. **gson** trivially is used to support json serialization : the main format used in **Nuts** to support configuration and descriptors. **jansi** is used to support terminal coloring and the "Nuts Text Coloring Format" (NTCF), a simple text format that helps creating colorful terminal applications.

=== 2. Companion tools projects
Companion tools include **nadmin**, **nsh** and **ndi**.These three applications are implemented following the "** `nuts` ** Application Framework" and hence are dependent on **nuts-api** library. They are recommended applications to install with **Nuts** itself, however they are not mandatory and may be ignored particularly when using **nuts-api** as library.
==== 2.1 **nadmin**

=== nadmin** (for **```nuts```** admin)is an administration tool to the **```nuts```** workspaces. It adds support to manage users, credentials, authorizations, workspaces and repositories by providing command line support for such actions.

==== 2.2 **nsh**

=== nsh** (for **```nuts```** shell) is simply a portable POSIX bash compatible implementation. It supports all common builtin commands (ls, cd, rm, ...) and adds support to grep, ssh and scp in a seamless manner. It also supports command line, scripts (including commons constructs with if, do, case, ...) and pipes (|)

==== 2.3 **ndi**

=== ndi** (for **```nuts```** desktop integration)is simply a helper tool to support seamless integration of **```nuts```** commands in your favorite operating system and environment. **ndi** is responsible of creating script shortcuts to your common commands so that you can invoke tem directly from your environment. For instance it creates an "nadmin" script and configures your PATH environment to help calling the nuts admin tool instead of the common way to do so "nuts nadmin". On window system, **ndi** will create shortcuts and menus.

=== 3. Toolbox projects

=== ```nuts```** comes with an array of tools out of the box you can install and play with. Here are these tools

==== 3.1 **nded**

=== nded** for "**```nuts```** Descriptor Editor" is a small tool for creating and editing json **```nuts```** descriptor file. It is intended to be called by automation tools.

==== 3.2 **nclown**

=== nclown** is an angular web application frontend for **```nuts```**. It helps navigating, searching and installing artifacts. It is intended to be a web admin tool as well.

==== 3.3 **nserver**

=== nserver** is a standalone application that runs a small http server that will expose a workspace as a remote repository to other **Nuts** installations. This is the simplest way to mirror a workspace and share artifacts between networked nodes.

==== 3.4 **nwar**

=== nwar** (for **```nuts```** Web Application Archive) is a web application that exposes **nserver** as a war to be deployed on a more mature http server or container.

==== 3.5 **ndexer**

=== ndexer** (for Indexer) is a lucene powered index for **```nuts```**. It can be shared across multiple **```nuts```** workspaces and processes.

==== 3.6 **feenoo**

=== feenoo** is a small search tool. It searches for files, files contents and classes within jars. You ca search for files than contains some text or jars that contain some class, or jars of a specific version of java.
The name **feenoo** comes form the Tunisian dialect and means "where is it?".
==== 3.7 **file-version**

=== file-version** is a small tool that helps detecting files versions. It supports jar, war, ear, dll and exe file versions. It opens a file and looks for it's version in its meta-data.

==== 3.8 **nmysql**

=== nmysql** is a companion tool to the mysql and mariadb servers. The initial actions supported are backup and restore including push/pull mechanism from/to a couple of databases for synchronization. It supports jdbc and ssh based access to remote mysql/mariadb installation.

==== 3.9 **ntomcat**

=== ntomcat** is a companion tool to the tomcat http server. The initial actions supported are start, stop, status, configure (http ports etc..) and deploy. It supports as well installation of several versions of Tomcat and multi domain configuration for deployments.

==== 3.10 **nderby**

=== nderby** is a companion tool to the derby database server. The initial actions supported are start, stop, status and configure. It supports as well installation of several versions of Derby.

==== 3.11 **nmvn**

=== nmvn** is a companion tool to maven. It supports installations of several versions of it and running them seamlessly.

==== 3.12 **worky**

=== worky** is a developer centered tool. The 'y' in **worky** refers to 'my' in the "Tunisian Dialect" and hence means "my work". **Worky** is the tool we - maven users - need to check if the version of project we are working on is yet to be deployed to nexus or not. So basically it checks if the version is the same, and downloads the server's version and then compares binaries to local project's to check if we have missed to update the version in our pom.xml. I know I'm not the only one having pain with jar deployments to nexus. **Worky** does other things as well to help me on on daily basis.

=== 4. Library Projects
Library projects are several libraries that add ** `nuts` ** support in a particular environment or domain.
==== 4.1 **nuts-tomcat-classloader**
This is a must-have feature in your web application if deployed on Tomcat. It solves the following problem : a simple war application is surprisingly fat with too many jars (hundreds of Megas) you need to upload each time you change a single file or class in your web project. Basically all the jars included in the lib folder of the war are to be uploaded each time to the remote Tomcat server. The common solution is to use "provided" scope in maven and put your jars in Tomcat lib or ext folders. This is a bad approach if you are using a single Tomcat process for multiple applications. **nuts-tomcat-classloader** simply uses **Nuts** to download libraries when the application is deployed based on the **pom.xml** you provide and include them in the current web application class loader. Hence, the war becomes lighter than ever. **Nuts** cache mechanisms optimizes bandwidth and makes this more convenient by sharing the same jar files between applications depending on the same versions. All you have to do is to add this library to your application and configure your **pom.xml** accordingly.
==== 4.2 **nuts-servlet**
Basically this is the simplest way to include **nserver** into your web application.
==== 4.3 **nuts-lib-template**
This library provides helper methods to manipulate maven pom.xml and generate simple Java files while supporting ** `nuts` ** concepts. It is used in other tools that are meant to generate maven projects.
=== 5. Other Projects
Other projects you may encounter in the repository are WIP projects that may be continued or discontinued.
This includes : **nutsc** (a native c bootstrapper) and **nuts-installer** (a **Nuts** installer tool)

=== 6. Honorable mentions
Although not included in this Git repository some other tools are based on ** `nuts` ** and hence are installable using  `nuts install the-app`  command. Those tools are published in other repositories.
6.1 **netbeans-launcher** : this tool supports installation and launch of multiple netbeans instances in parallel. See link:https://github.com/thevpc/netbeans-launcher[Netbeans Launcher GitHub Repository]
6.2 **upa-box** : this tool supports creation of UPA aware projects. UPA is a non structured ORM for the Java Language. See link:https://github.com/thevpc/upa[Netbeans Launcher GitHub Repository]
6.3 **vr-box** : this tool supports creation of VR aware projects. VR is a web portal framework. See link:https://github.com/thevpc/vr[Netbeans Launcher GitHub Repository]

== Nuts Commandline

=== Nuts** supports a specific format for command line arguments. This format is the format supported in **```nuts```** Application Framewok (NAF) and as such all NAF applications support the same command line arguments format.
Arguments in ** `nuts` ** can be options or non options. Options always start with dash (-). 
=== Short vs Long Options
Options can be long options (starts with double dash) or short options (start with a single dash). 
Many arguments support both forms. For instance "-w" and "--workspace" are the spported forms to define the workspace location in the nuts command.


=== Option Values
Options can also support a value of type string or boolean.  The value can be suffixed to the option while separated with '=' sign or immediately after the option. As an example "-w=/myfolder/myworkspace" and  "--workspace /myfolder/myworkspace" are equivalent.


=== Boolean Options
Particularly, when the value is a boolean, the value do not need to be defined. As a result "--skip-companions" and "--skip-companions=true" are equivalent. However "--skip-companions true" is not (because the option is of type boolean) and "true" will be parsed as a NonOption.

To define a "false" value to the boolean option we can either suffix with "=false" or prefix with "!" or "~" sign. 
Hence, "--skip-companions=false", "--!skip-companions" and "--~skip-companions" are all equivalent.


=== Combo Simple Options
Simple options can be grouped in a single word. "-ls" is equivalent to "-l -s". So one should be careful. 
One exception though. For portability reasons, "-version" is considered a single short option.


=== Ignoring Options, Comments
Options starting with "-//" and "--//" are simply ignored by the command line parser.


=== Nuts Option Types

Options in ** `nuts` ** are regrouped in multiple categories. An option can belong to multiple categories though.

== Create Options : such options are only relevant when creating a new workspace. They define the configuration of the workspace to create. They will be ignored when the workspace already exists. Examples include
    * --skip-companions
    * --archetype
    * --store-strategy
    * --standalone


== Open Options : such options are relevant when creating a new workspace or when opening an existing workspace. They define the way commands are executed. Examples include
    * --workspace
    * --bot
    * --reset


== Exported Options : are passed to sub-**nuts**-processes that will be created by **nuts**. For instance when nuts will call the **nsh** command it will spawn a new process. In such case, these options are passed to the sub-process as environment variable.
    * --workspace
    * --bot
    * --no-color


== Application Options : are options that are by default supported by Applications using NAF (Nuts Application Framework) (as well as Nuts it self).
    * --help
    * --version

all ** `nuts` ** options are described in the command help. Just type :

=== Why do we need a package manager for Java. Isn't **Maven** enough?
please read link:../intro/nuts-and-maven.md[Nuts Introduction, Why and What for]
=== What does Nuts mean and why ?

=== ```nuts```** stands for "Network Updatable Things Services". It helps managing things (artifacts of any type, not only java).
The Name also helps depicting another idea : ** `nuts` ** is a good companion and complement to Maven tool. The word maven (MAY-vin), from Yiddish, means a super-enthusiastic expert/fan/connoisseur/Wizard.And where wizards are, fools and ** `nuts` ** must be. ** `nuts` ** is the foolish tool to support the deployment and not the build. Hence the name.



=== Does nuts support only jar packaging
Not only. ** `nuts` ** supports all packagings supported by maven. This includes  pom , jar , maven-plugin , ejb , war , ear , rar.However ** `nuts` ** is also intended to support any "thing" including "exe" ,"dll", "so", "zip" files, etc.
=== ```nuts```** differs from maven as it defines other properties to the artifact descriptor (aka pom in maven) : os (operating system),
arch (hardware architecture), osdist (relevant for linux for instance : opensuse, ubuntu) and platform (relevant to vm platforms like java vm, dotnet clr, etc).
Such properties are queried to download the most appropriate binaries for the the current characteristics.



=== Can I contribute to the project
I hoped you would ask this question. Sure. 
You can drop me an email to add you as contributor or fork the repository and ping a pull request. 
You can also open a new issue for feature implementation to invite any other contributor to implement that feature (or even implement it your self).


=== Where can I find Documentation about the Project
The doc folder is intended to include documentation. The wiki also should help. 


=== How can I make my application "Nuts aware"
If by ** `nuts` ** aware you mean that you would download your application and run it using ** `nuts` **, then you just need to create the application using maven and deploy your application to the public maven central.Nothing really special is to be done from your side. You do not have to use plugins like 'maven-assembly-plugin' and 'maven-shade-plugin' to include your dependencies.
Or, you can also use NAF (** `nuts` ** Application Framework) make your application full featured "Nuts aware" application.

=== Why should I consider implementing my terminal application using Nuts Application Framework (NAF)
First of all, NAF is a simple 300k jar so for what it provided to you, you would be surprised. 
Indeed, implementing your application using NAF will provide you a clean way to :

== seamless integration with **```nuts```** and all other NAF applications


== support standard file system layout (XDG) where config files and log files are not necessarily in the same folder see [Nuts File System](../advanced/filesystem.md) for more details.


== support application life cycle events (onInstall, onUninstall, onUpgrade),


== standard support of command line arguments


== dynamic dependency aware class loading


== terminal coloring and components (progress bar, etc...)


== json,xml,table,tree and plain format support out of the box


== pipe manipulation when calling sub processes


== advanced io features (persistence Locks, monitored downloads, compression, file hashing....)


== standard ways to support and use installed platforms (installed JRE, JDK, ...)


== and more...



=== Can I use NAF for non terminal applications, Swing or JavaFX perhaps
Sure, you will be able to benefit of all the items in the preceding question but terminal coloring wont be relevant of course. 
Check netbeans-launcher in github. It's a good example of how interesting is to use NAF in non terminal applications.

=== System Requirements
Here are all ** `nuts` ** requirements :
* **Java** : ** `nuts` ** requires a valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version **8** or above to execute.

* **System Memory**: ** `nuts` ** memory footprint is very little and has no minimum RAM requirements.

* **Disk**: 2.5Mo on the disk are required for the ** `nuts` ** installation itself. In addition to that, additional disk space will be used for your local Nuts workspace. The size of your local workspace will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.

* **Operating System**: ** `nuts` ** is able to run on any java enabled Operating System including all recent versions of Windows, Linux and MacOS.
To check if you have a valid java installation type


[source,bash]
----

----

The result would be equivalent to the following. Just be sure the version is 1.8 or over. In this example, 
the java version is 1.8.0_211

Linux Systems installation is based on bash shell. First launch will configure "~/.bashrc" so that **nuts** and other companion tool commands will be available in any future terminal instances.Using ** `nuts` ** on unix-like system should be seamless. A simple bash terminal (Gnome Terminal, KDE Konsole,...) is already a nuts-aware terminal.
All Linux versions and distributions should work with or without XWindow (or equivalent). Graphical system is required only if you plan to run a gui application using **nuts**.All tests where performed on OpenSuse Tumbleweed.

Yous should then see some log like the following :


As you can see, installation upon first launch, will also trigger installation of other optional programs called "companion tools".
Actually they are recommended helpful tools :
  + **ndi** which stands for __Nuts Desktop Integration__ that helps configuring the desktop to better     interact with ** `nuts` ** by for instance creating shortcuts.  + **nsh** which stands for __Nuts Shell__ , a bash compatible shell implementation program that will run equally on linux an windows systems.  + **nadmin** an administration tool for ** `nuts` ** 

IMPORTANT: 
After installation, you need to restart the terminal application for the configuration to take effet.





=== Test Installation
To test installation the simplest way is to open a nuts-aware terminal and type : 


[source,]
----
nuts --version

----

It should show a result in the format : nuts-api-version/nuts-impl-version

=== Run a command

To run a command using **nuts** just type

[source,]
----
nuts <command>

----

Several commands are available, and you still be able to run any java and non java application. More info is available in the ** `nuts` ** official link:https://github.com/thevpc/nuts/wiki[wiki] .

----

==== Running a deployed artifact
You can run any jar using ** `nuts` ** as far as the jar is accessible from one of the supported repositories.By default, ** `nuts` ** supports: + maven central
 + local maven folder (~/.m2)

You can configure other repositories or even implement your own if you need to.

The jar will be parsed to check form maven descriptor so that dependencies will be resolved and downloaded on the fly.
Then, all executable classes (public with static void main method) are enumerated. You can actually run any of them when prompted. Any jar built using maven should be well described and can be run using its artifact long id.


==== Artifact Long Ids

=== ```nuts```** long ids are a string representation of a unique identifier of the artifact. It has the following form :


[source,java]
----
groupId:artifactId#version

----

for instance, to install  `netbeans-launcher`  (which is a simple UI helping launch of multiple instances of netbeans), you can issue

[source,bash]
----
  nuts net.vpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

You do agree that this can be of some cumbersome to type. So you can simplify it to :


[source,bash]
----
  nuts netbeans-launcher

----

In this form, ** `nuts` ** will auto-detect both the  `groupId`  and the  `version` . The group id is detected if it is already imported (we will see later import a groupId). By default, there is a couple of groupIds that are automatically imported :

  +  `net.vpc.app`  (contains various applications of the author)  +  `net.vpc.nuts.toolbox`  (contains various companion tools of ** `nuts` **, such as  `nsh` ,  `nadmin` ,  `ndi` , ...)
And it turns out, hopefully, that netbeans-launcher belongs to an imported groupId, so we can omit it.
Besides, if no version is provided, ** `nuts` ** will also auto-detect the best version to execute. If the application is already installed, the version you choose to install will be resolved. If you have not installed any, the most recent version, obviously, will be detected for you.

==== Artifact Installation
Any java application can run using ** `nuts` ** but it has to be installed first. If you try to run the application before installing it, you will be prompted to confirm installation.To install our favorite application here we could have issued :

[source,bash]
----
  nuts install netbeans-launcher

----
But as we have tried to run the application first, it has been installed for us (after confirmation).


==== Multiple Artifact version Installation
One of the key features of ** `nuts` ** is the ability to install multiple versions of the same application.We can for instance type :

[source,bash]
----
  nuts install netbeans-launcher#1.2.2
  # then
  nuts install netbeans-launcher#1.2.0

----
Now we have two versions installed, the last one always is considered default one.
you can run either, using it's version

[source,bash]
----
  nuts netbeans-launcher#1.2.2 &
  # or
  nuts netbeans-launcher#1.2.0 &

----
Actually, when you have many versions installed for the same artifact and you try to run it without specifying the version, the last one installed will be considered. To be more precise, an artifact has a default version when it is installed. This default version is considered when no explicit version is typed.
In our example, when we type 

[source,]
----
  nuts netbeans-launcher &

----
the 1.2.0 version will be invoked because the artifact is already installed and the default version points to the last one installed. So if you want to switch back to version 1.2.2 you just have to re-install it. Don't worry, no file will be downloaded again, nuts will detect that the version is not marked as default and will switch it to.


==== Searching artifacts
Now let's take a look at installed artifacts. We will type :

[source,bash]
----
  nuts search --installed

----
This will list all installed artifacts. We can get a better listing using long format :

[source,bash]
----
  nuts search --installed -l

----
you will see something like


[source,]
----
I-X 2019-08-21 04:54:22.951 anonymous vpc-public-maven net.vpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.0
i-X 2019-08-21 04:54:05.196 anonymous vpc-public-maven net.vpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

The first column here is a the artifact status that helps getting zipped information of the artifact. the 'I' stands for 'installed and default' whereas, 'i' is simply 'installed'. The 'X' stands for 'executable application', where 'x' is simply 'executable'. Roughly said, executable applications are executables aware of (or depends on) **nuts**, as they provide a special api that helps nuts to get more information and more features for the application. As an example, executable applications have special OnInstall and OnUninstall hooks called by nuts.The second and the third columns are date and time of installation. The fourth column points to the installation user. When Secure mode has not been enabled (which is the default), you are running nuts as 'anonymous'.
The fifth column shows the repository from which the package was installed. And the last column depicts the artifact long id.


==== Running local jar file with its dependencies
Let's suppose that my-app.jar is a maven created jar (contains META-INF/maven files) with a number of dependencies. ** `nuts` ** is able to download on the fly needed dependencies, detect the Main class (no need for MANIFEST.MF) and run the application. If a Main-Class Attribute was detected in a valid MANIFEST.MF, il will be considered.
If more than one class is detected with a main method, ** `nuts` ** will ask for the current class to run.
When you run a local file, ** `nuts` ** will behave as if the app is installed (in the given path, an no need to invoke install command). Local files are detected if they are denoted by a valid path (containing '/' or '\' depending on the underlying operating system).Dependencies will be downloaded as well (and cached in the workspace)


[source,bash]
----
nuts ./my-app.jar some-argument-of-my-app

----
If you need to pass JVM arguments you have to prefix them with "--exec". So if you want to fix maximum heap size use 


[source,bash]
----
nuts --exe -Xms1G -Xmx2G ./my-app.jar argument-1 argument-2

== Application

=== ☕ NutsApplication

[source,java]
----
public  abstract  net.vpc.app.nuts.NutsApplication

----
Nuts Application is the Top Level class to be handled by nuts as rich console
application. By default NutsApplication classes :


* have a nutsApplication=true in their descriptor file

* support inheritance of all workspace options (from caller nuts
process)

* enables auto-complete mode to help forecasting the next token in the
command line

* enables install mode to be executed when the jar is installed in nuts
repos

* enables uninstall mode to be executed when the jar is uninstaleld from
nuts repos

* enables update mode to be executed when the a new version of the same jar
has been installed

* have many default options enabled (such as --help, --version, --json,

** table, etc.) and thus support natively multi output channels

Typically a Nuts Application follows this code pattern :

[source,]
----

  public class MyApplication extends NutsApplication{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // just create an instance and call runAndExit in the main method
        new MyApplication().runAndExit(args);
    }
    // do the main staff in launch method
    public void run(NutsApplicationContext appContext) {
        boolean myBooleanOption=false;
        NutsCommandLine cmdLine=appContext.getCommandLine()
        boolean boolOption=false;
        String stringOption=null;
        Argument a;
        while(cmdLine.hasNext()){
            if(appContext.configureFirst(cmdLine)){
                //do nothing
            }else {
                 a=cmdLine.peek();
                 switch(a.getStringKey())[
                     case "-o": case "--option":{
                         boolOption=cmdLine.nextBoolean().getBooleanValue();
                         break;
                     }
                     case "-n": case "--name":{
                         stringOption=cmdLine.nextString().getStringValue();
                         break;
                     }
                     default:{
                         cmdLine.unexpectedArgument();
                     }
                 }
            }
        }
        // test if application is running in exec mode
        // (and not in autoComplete mode)
        if(cmdLine.isExecMode()){
             //do the good staff here
        }
    }
  }

=== ☕ NutsCommandLine

[source,java]
----
public  net.vpc.app.nuts.NutsCommandLine

----
Simple Command line parser implementation. The command line supports
arguments in the following forms :


* non option arguments : any argument that does not start with '-'

* 
long option arguments : any argument that starts with a single '--' in the
form of

[source,]
----
--[//][!]?[^=]*[=.*]

----


* // means disabling the option

* ! means switching (to 'false') the option's value

* the string before the '=' is the option's key

* the string after the '=' is the option's value

Examples :


* --!enable : option 'enable' with 'false' value

* --enable=yes : option 'enable' with 'yes' value

* --!enable=yes : invalid option (no error will be thrown but the result is
undefined)



* 
simple option arguments : any argument that starts with a single '-' in the
form of

[source,]
----
-[//][!]?[a-z][=.*]

----


* -!enable (with expandSimpleOptions=false) : option 'enable' with 'false'
value

* --enable=yes : option 'enable' with 'yes' value

* --!enable=yes : invalid option (no error will be thrown but the result is
undefined)




* 
condensed simple option arguments : any argument that starts with a single
'-' in the form of

[source,]
----
-[//]([!]?[a-z])+[=.*]

----
options and is parsable when expandSimpleOptions=true. When activating
expandSimpleOptions, multi characters key will be expanded as multiple
separate simple options Examples :


* -!enable (with expandSimpleOptions=false) : option 'enable' with 'false'
value

* --enable=yes : option 'enable' with 'yes' value

* --!enable=yes : invalid option (no error will be thrown but the result is
undefined)




* long option arguments : any argument that starts with a '--'

option may start with '!' to switch armed flags expandSimpleOptions : when
activated

=== ☕ NutsDescriptor

[source,java]
----
public  net.vpc.app.nuts.NutsDescriptor

----
Nuts descriptors define an **immutable** image to all information needed to execute an artifact.It resembles to maven's pom file but it focuses on execution information
rather then build information. Common features are inheritance
dependencies, standard dependencies, exclusions and properties.
However nuts descriptor adds new features such as :


* multiple parent inheritance

* executable/nuts-executable flag

* environment (arch, os, dist,platform) filters

* classifiers may be mapped to environment (think of dlls for windows and so for linux)

A versatile way to change descriptor is to use builder ( ` #builder()` ).

----
--[//][!]?[^=]*[=.*]

----


* // means disabling the option

* ! means switching (to 'false') the option's value

* the string before the '=' is the option's key

* the string after the '=' is the option's value

Examples :


* --!enable : option 'enable' with 'false' value

* --enable=yes : option 'enable' with 'yes' value

* --!enable=yes : invalid option (no error will be thrown but the result
is undefined)



* 
simple option arguments : any argument that starts with a single '-' in the
form of

[source,]
----
-[//][!]?[a-z][=.*]

----
if expandSimpleOptions=false. When activating expandSimpleOptions, multi
characters key will be expanded as multiple separate simple options Examples
:


* -!enable (with expandSimpleOptions=false) : option 'enable' with 'false'
value

* --enable=yes : option 'enable' with 'yes' value

* --!enable=yes : invalid option (no error will be thrown but the result
is undefined)




* long option arguments : any argument that starts with a '--'

option may start with '!' to switch armed flags expandSimpleOptions : when
activated
