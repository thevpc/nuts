**`nuts`** exposes a set of commands :

=== misc


==== misc


======  Java Applications

This is a short list of applications that can be installed and run using `nuts` 


== cmd


=== Exec and Which Commands


**exec** command runs another command and **which** command does a dry run of it.

When one types


[source]
----

nuts netbeans-command

----

It's actually equivalent to


[source]
----

nuts exec netbeans-command

----

What is helpful with **exec** is that it permits passing extra parameters to application executors. In **nuts**, an application executor is an artifact that can be used to run other artifacts. For instance **nsh**, which is a **nuts** companion, is an executor for all "**.nsh" artifacts (yest script files are artifacts too). Some executors are specially handled such as "java" executor that is used to run all jars and basically all java based artifacts. Java executor for instance supports all java standard vm option arguments**

[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts exec -Xmx1G netbeans-launcher

----

Here we pass -Xmx1G option argument to java executor because **netbeans-launcher** will be resolved as a java based artifact. For what concerns **which** command, it does not really execute the command, it just resolves the command execution


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts which version ls
version : internal command 
ls : nuts alias (owner maven-local://net.thevpc.app.nuts.toolbox:nsh#0.8.5.0 ) : maven-local://net.thevpc.app.nuts.toolbox:nsh#0.8.5.0 -c ls

----

Here **which** returns that **version** is an internal command while **ls** is an alias to an artifact based command (nsh -c ls) which is called a "nuts alias". As you can see, ls is actually a sub command of nsh artifact.

======  1.2 External Commands

External commands are commands that will invoke another artifact. for instance


[source]
----

nuts netbeans-command

----

is running an external command which is net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2 artifact.

======  1.2 External Files & URLs

You can run any jar file using **nuts** as far as it fulfills two points : the files must contain a supported descriptor (if It's compiled with maven, it already has the supported descriptor) and the file should be typed as a path (it must contain a '/' or '' separator)


[source]
----

wget -N https://github.com/thevpc/vpc-public-maven/raw/master/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.2/netbeans-launcher-1.2.2.jar
nuts ./netbeans-launcher-1.2.2.jar

----

You can even run a remove file using its url format :


[source]
----

nuts https://github.com/thevpc/vpc-public-maven/raw/master/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.2/netbeans-launcher-1.2.2.jar

----

=====  2. Execution types

======  2.1 spawn

This is the default execution type where any external command will spawn a new process to execute within. Internal commands are not affected by this mode and are executed, always, in the current vm process (with embedded type).


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts --spawn ls

----

======  2.2 embedded

In this type the command will try not to spawn a new process but load in the current vm the commmand to run (as far as It's a java command)


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts --embedded ls

----

======  2.3 syscall

In this type, the command execution is delegated to the underlying operating system end hence will also swan a new process.


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts --syscall ls

----

=====  3 Execution modes

======  3.1 effective execution

This is the default execution mode where the command is really and effectively ran.

======  3.2 dry execution

In this mode, the command will be ran in dry mode with no side effects which implies a "simulation" of the execution.


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts --dry version
[dry] internal version 

----

=== Fetch Command


**fetch** command is used to download content of an artifact when you exactly know of it's nuts long id (which is required). This will download a cached version of the artifact in the local machine (the artifact passes to 'fetched' status)


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts fetch net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

=== Info Command


**info** command is a more verbose command than version. It shows a lot of other **nuts** properties that describe the booted workspace, such as the workspace name, the store locations (artifacts, caches, ....)

=== Install Command


A part from URL and path based executions, an artifact should be installed to be run. Installation can be auto fired when you first execute the artifact (you will be prompted to install the artifact) or manually using the **install** command. Note that when you run directly a jar file as a path or url, the artifact will not be installed! to install an application just type


[source]
----

nuts install <your-artifact-query-here>

----

For example


[source]
----

nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

you may use any artifact query (see search command section) to install a command.


[source]
----

nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-*

----

if the artifact is already installed, you should use the force flag (--force)


[source]
----

nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2
#this second time we have to force install
nuts install -- force net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

One exception is when you want to switch between multiple versions installed to set the default one, you can omit the --force flag. Actually, when multiple version of the same artifact are installed all of them are executable directly by specifying the right version. When you specify no version, the default one is selected for you. And to make is simple, the default one is the last one you ran an install command for it.


[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2
me@linux:~> nuts netbeans-launcher
1.2.2
me@linux:~> nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.1
me@linux:~> nuts netbeans-launcher
1.2.1
me@linux:~> nuts install net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2
1.2.2

----

You can find all installed artifacts using 'nuts search --installed' command

=====  Purpose

The install command is used to install or reinstall packages.

* A+B  : read A main package and B dependencies

* A+B? : ask, if confirmed, read A main package and B dependencies.

* require : deploy package as 'required'

* install : deploy package as 'installed'

* nothing : do nothing
The available strategies are

* require   : install the package and all of its dependencies as required class installed package

* install   : install the package and all of its dependencies as first class installed package

* reinstall : re-install or re-required the package and all of its dependencies

* repair    : repair (re-install or re-required) the given dependency
"required class installed package" can be removed (uninstalled automatically by nuts when none  of the depending package is nomore installed.

 Is a new Open Source Package Manager to help install packages
 and libraries for runtime execution. Nuts is the ultimate companion for
 maven (and other build managers) as it helps installing all package
 dependencies at runtime. Nuts is not tied to java and is a good choice
 to share shell scripts and other 'Things' . It's based on an extensible
 architecture to help supporting a large range of sub managers / repositories.

=== Nuts Commands


Nuts supports multiple types of commands (internal , external), multiple types of execution (embedded, spawn, and system execution) and multiple modes of execution (effective, dry).

Internal Commands include:

* `welcome` : this is the default command that simply shows a welcome message and exits


* `help` : documentation and help command for `nuts` and applications and exits 


* `version` : show nuts version and exits


* `info` : show detailed `nuts` installation information and exits


* `license` : simply show `nuts` license and exits


* `search` : search for applications installed/to install


* `fetch` : download applications (without installing)


* `which` : resolve the appropriate application (or an internal command) for a given command


* `exec` : execute c(or an internal command)


* `install` : installs an application 


* `uninstall` : uninstalls an application


* `update` : updates an installed application


* `reinstall` : reinstall an existing application


* `check-updates` : checks for updates of an application (do not perform the update)


* `deploy` : deploys a local application (and its descriptors) to a local repository


* `push` : syncronizes the local repositry to it's remote peer and hence, deploy to a remote repository.


* `bundle` : creates a standalone bundle as a complete nuts workspace that serve a single application


* `settings` : this is main settings/configuration commands to manage nuts workspaces, apps, security, etc.


=== Search Command


Artifact can be in multiple states. they can be

* 'unavailable' if no registered repository can serve that artifact

* 'available' if there is at least one repository that can serve that artifact

* 'fetched' if there is a repository that can serve the artifact from local machine. This happens either if the repository is a local one (for instance a folder repository) or the repository has already downloaded and cached the artifact

* 'installed' if the artifact is fetched and installed in the the machine.

* 'installed default' if the artifact is installed and marked as default
To search for these artifacts status you will use the appropriate option flag with an artifact query. An artifact query is a generalization of an artifact id where you may use wild cards and version intervals in it. These are some examples of artifact queries.


[source]
----

# all artifacts that start with netbeans, whatever groupId they belong to
# nuts search netbeans*

# all artifacts that start with netbeans, whatever groupId they belong to. same as the latter.
# nuts search *:netbeans*

# all artifacts in the net.thevpc.app groupId
# nuts search net.thevpc.*:*

# all artifacts in the net.thevpc.* groupId which includes all of net.thevpc.app and net.thevpc.app.example for instance.
# nuts search net.thevpc.*:*

# all artifacts that start with netbeans and is available for windows operating system in x86_64 architecture
# nuts search netbeans*?os=windows&arch=x86_64

# all netbeans launcher version that are greater than 1.2.0 (excluding 1.2.0)
# nuts search netbeans-launcher#]1.2.0,[

# all netbeans launcher version that are greater than 1.2.0 (including 1.2.0)
# nuts search netbeans-launcher#[1.2.0,[


----

You can then use the these flags to tighten your search :

* --installed (or -i) : search only for installed artifacts


* --local     : search only for fetched artifacts


* --remote    : search only for non fetched artifacts


* --online    : search in installed then in local then in remote, stop when you first find a result.


* --anywhere  (or -a) : search in installed and local and remote, return all results.


You can also change the output layout using --long (or -l) flag

Indeed, all of **nuts** commands support the following formats : **plain**, **json**, **xml**, **table** and **tree** because **nuts** adds support to multi format output by default. You can switch to any of them for any command by adding the right option in **nuts** (typically --plain, --json, --xml, --table and --tree). I know this is awesome!.

**search** is a very versatile command, you are welcome to run "nuts search --help" to get more information.
=== Version Command


This command will show **nuts** version. It's helpful to note that **nuts** has a couple of components : api and impl. api is the **nuts** bootstrap jar (actually nuts-**.jar, ~500Ko of size) that contains only the minimum code to use nuts and to download the full implementation (3Mo of size) : impl component. Usually, the implementation version starts with the api version but this should be no rule.**

[source]
----

me@linux:~> nuts version
0.8.5/0.8.5.0

----

Here the **version** command show api version (0.8.5) and the impl version (0.8.5.0)
=== Welcome Command


This command does absolutely nothing but showing this message

=== Commands


**`nuts`** exposes a set of commands :

* `exec`               : execute an artifact or a command


* `which`              : detect the proper artifact or system command to execute


* `install`, `uninstall` : install/uninstall an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)


* `update`,`check-updates`  : search for updates


* `deploy`, `undeploy`   : manage artifacts (artifact installers) on the local repositories


* `fetch`, `push`        : download from, upload to remote repositories


* `search`             : search for existing/installable artifacts


* `welcome`            : a command that does nothing but bootstrapping **`nuts`** and showing a welcome message.


== concepts


=== Aliases, Imports & Launchers


Aliases, Imports and launchers, are three features in nuts where you can call artifacts with a simple word instead of using the full id. Indeed, usually, artifacts are uniquely identified by groupId, artifactId, version and classifier (whenever applicable). This is kind of cumbersome if most of the cases:


[source,bash]
----

nuts net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0

----

=====  Imports

Imports help you discard groupId and call/install artifacts using only artifactId. You can as an example import 'com.my-company' and as a result any artifact under 'com.mycompany' is resolved automatically. Actually 'com.my-company:my-app' and 'com.my-company.my-app:my-app' are


[source,bash]
----

nuts net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0
# becomes
nuts settings add import net.thevpc.toolbox
# now call it simply with
nuts nsh#0.8.5.0
# or even simpler with
nuts nsh

----

As a matter of fact, there is a default import defined 'net.thevpc'

=====  Aliases

Aliases help you define your own command by calling existing artifacts and defining some arguments as well. It's very similar to shell aliases where you define `ll` as an alias to `/bin/ls -l` for example.


[source,bash]
----

nuts net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0
# becomes
nuts settings add alias ll='net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0 -c ls -l'
# now call it simply with
nuts ll

----

=====  Launchers

Launchers help you define your own system command by calling nuts with existing artifacts and even creating Desktop Environment Shortcuts and Icons (whenever GUI is applicable). 


[source,bash]
----

nuts net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0
# becomes
nuts settings add launcher --menu --desktop 'net.thevpc.nsh:nsh#0.8.5.0'
# now call it simply click on the desktop icon or open via system menu

----

=== Automation


`nuts` has been designed and implemented with automation and devops philosophy in mind.

`nuts` Application Framework infrastructure provides a seamless support process automation with structured output, including json, xml, yaml, tson and so on. You can for instance call the  POSIX ls command and get the file list as `json`. You can then process this `json`and extract meaningful information and pass it to the next command using standard pipe mechanism.  Think of this as a general pattern for any and all commands you can run via nuts. 

Besides, automation includes dynamic classloading of on-the-fly dependencies (remotely resolved and downloaded) to make usage of a feature you need such as installing a tomcat version that is compatible with the jre version you run.

Automation requires also partitioning, isolation, sand-boxing, security reinforcements and portability. This is ensured by workspace feature that helps isolating the application dependencies from other applications, authentication and authorisation mechanisms to limit access to nuts configurations (and hence available repositories used for dependency resolution) and to system resources (running with or without elevated privileges) and finally environment adaptability to handle appropriate support for each architecture (x86_32,itanium_64,...), operating system (linux, windows,...), shell (bash, zsh,...), platform (java, dotnet, ...) and desktop environment.

=== Command Line Arguments


**nuts** supports a specific format for command line arguments. This format is the format supported in **`nuts`** Application Framework (NAF) and as such all NAF applications support the same command line arguments format. Arguments in **`nuts`** can be options or non options. Options always start with hyphen (-). 

=====  Short vs Long Options

Options can be long options (starts with double hyphen) or short options (start with a single hyphen).  Many arguments support both forms. For instance "-w" and "--workspace" are the supported forms to define the workspace location in the nuts command.

=====  Valued / Non-valued Options

Options can also support a value of type string or boolean. The value can be suffixed to the option while separated with '=' sign or immediately after the option. 

As an example, all are equivalent.  


[source,sh]
----

nuts -w=/myfolder/myworkspace
nuts -w /myfolder/myworkspace
nuts --workspace /myfolder/myworkspace
nuts --workspace=/myfolder/myworkspace

----

Of course, not all options can support values, an not all options neither support the suffixed and/or the non-suffixed mode. Please relate to the documentation of nuts or the application you are using to know how to use the options.

=====  Boolean Options

Particularly, when the value is a boolean, the value do not need to be defined. As a result "--install-companions" and "--install-companions=true" are equivalent. However "--install-companions true" is not (because the option is of type boolean) and "true" will be parsed as a NonOption.

To define a "false" value to the boolean option we can either suffix with "=false" or prefix with "!" or "~" sign.  Hence, "--install-companions=false", "--!install-companions" and "--~install-companions" are all equivalent. Note also that `~` if referred to `!` because in bash shells (and som other shells) `!` will be expanded in a special manner.

=====  Combo Simple Options

Simple options can be grouped in a single word. "-ls" is equivalent to "-l -s". So one should be careful.  One exception though. For portability reasons, "-version" is considered a single short option.

=====  Ignoring Options, Comments

Options starting with "-//" and "--//" are simply ignored by the command line parser.

=====  Nuts Option Types

Options in **`nuts`** are can be of one of the following categories :

* Create Options : such options are only relevant when creating a new workspace. They define the configuration of the workspace to create. They will be ignored when the workspace already exists. They will be ignored too, in sub-processes. Examples include

** --install-companions


** --archetype


** --store-strategy


** --standalone


* Runtime Options : such options are relevant when running a workspace (be it existing or to be created) and are not passed to sub-processes

** --reset


** --recover


** --dry


** --version


* Exported Options : are passed to sub-**nuts**-processes that will be created by **nuts**. For instance when nuts will call the **nsh** command it will spawn a new process. In such case, these options are passed to the sub-process as environment variable.


** --workspace


** --global


** --color


** --bot


* Executor Options : are options that are supported byte the package executor. Most of the time this will be the java executor and hence this coincides with the JVM options) 

** -Xmx...


** -Xmx


** -D...


* Custom Nuts options : are special `nuts` options that are specific to nuts implementation or validation process to be promoted to standard options. The arguments parser will never report an error regarding such options. They are used when available and valid. they will be ignored in all other cases. Such options start with triple hyphen (---)


** ---monitor.enabled


** ---monitor.start


** ---show-command


** ---perf


** ---init-platforms


** ---init-scripts


** ---init-java


** ---system-desktop-launcher


** ---system-menu-launcher


** ---system-custom-launcher


* Application Options : are options that are by default supported by Applications using NAF (Nuts Application Framework) (as well as Nuts it self).

** --help


** --version


all **`nuts`** options are described in the command help. Just type :

nuts --help

=== File system


**`nuts`** manages multiple workspaces. It has a default one located at ~/.config/nuts (~ is the user home directory). Each workspace handles a database and files related to the installed applications. The workspace has a specific layout to store different types of files relatives to your applications. **nuts** is largely inspired by [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and hence defines several  store locations for each file type. Such organization of folders is called Layout and is dependent on the current operating system, the layout strategy and any custom configuration.

=====  Store Locations

Supported Store Locations are : 

**`nuts`** File System defines the following folders :

* **config** : defines the base directory relative to which application specific configuration files should be stored.


* **apps** : defines the base directory relative to which application executable binaries should be stored 


* **lib** : defines the base directory relative to which application non executable binaries should be stored 


* **var** : defines the base directory relative to which application specific data files (other than config) should be stored


* **log** : defines the base directory relative to which application specific log and trace files should be stored


* **temp** : defines the base directory relative to which application specific temporary files should be stored


* **cache** : defines the base directory relative to which application non-essential data and binary files should be stored to optimize bandwidth or performance


* **run** : defines the base directory relative to which application-specific non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored


**`nuts`** defines such distinct folders (named Store Locations) for storing different types of application data according to your operating system.

On Windows Systems the default locations are :

** apps     : "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/apps"

** lib      : "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/lib"

** config   : "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/config"

** var      : "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/var"

** log      : "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/log"

** temp     : "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/temp"

** cache    : "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/cache"

** run      : "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/run"
On Linux, Unix, MacOS and any POSIX System the default locations are :

** config   : "$HOME/.config/nuts"

** apps     : "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/apps"

** lib      : "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/lib"

** var      : "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/var"

** log      : "$HOME/.local/log/nuts"

** cache    : "$HOME/.cache/nuts"

** temp     : "$java.io.tmpdir/$username/nuts"

** run      : "/run/user/$USER_ID/nuts"
As an example, the configuration folder for the artifact net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.4 in the default workspace in a Linux environment is


[source]
----

home/me/.config/nuts/default-workspace/config/id/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.4/

----

And the log file "app.log" for the same artifact in the workspace named "personal" in a Windows environment is located at


[source]
----

C:/Users/me/AppData/Roaming/nuts/log/nuts/personal/config/id/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.4/app.log

----

=====  Store Location Strategies

When you install any application using the **`nuts`** command a set of specific folders for the presented Store Locations are created. For that,  two strategies exist : **Exploded strategy** (the default) and **Standalone strategy**.  

In **Exploded strategy**  **`nuts`** defines top level folders (in linux ~/.config for config Store Location etc), and then creates withing each top level Store Location a sub folder for the given application (or application version to be more specific). This helps putting all your config files in a SSD partition for instance and make **nuts** run faster. However if you are interested in the backup or roaming of your workspace, this may be not the best approach.

The **Standalone strategy**   is indeed provided mainly for Roaming workspaces that can be shared, copied, moved to other locations. A single root folder will contain all of the Store Locations.

As an example, in "Standalone Strategy", the configuration folder for the artifact net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.4 in the default workspace in a Linux environment is


[source]
----

home/me/.config/nuts/default-workspace/config/id/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.4/

----

And the log file "app.log" for the same artifact in the workspace named "personal" in the same Linux environment is located at


[source]
----

/home/me/.config/nuts/default-workspace/log/id/net/vpc/app/netbeans-launcher/1.2.4/

----

You can see here that the following folder will contain ALL the data files of the workspace.


[source]
----

/home/me/.config/nuts/default-workspace

----

whereas in the **Exploded strategy** the Store Location are "exploded" into multiple root folders.

=====  Custom Store Locations

Of course, you are able to configure separately each Store Location to meet your needs.

======  Selecting strategies

The following command will create an exploded workspace


[source]
----

nuts -w my-workspace --exploded

----

The following command will create a standalone workspace


[source]
----

nuts -w my-workspace --standalone

----

======  Finer Customization

The following command will create an exploded workspace and moves all config files to the SSD partition folder /myssd/myconfig


[source]
----

nuts -w my-workspace --system-conf-home=/myssd/myconfig

----

You can type help for more details.

=== Nuts Text Format


====  Nuts Text Format

**`nuts`** comes up with a simple coloring syntax that helps writing better looking portable command line programs. standard output is automatically configured to accept the "Nuts Text Format" (NTF) syntax.  Though it remains possible to disable this ability using the --!color standard option (or programmatically,  see **`nuts`** API documentation). NTF will be translated to the underlying terminal implementation using ANSI  escape code on linux/windows terminals if available.

Here after a showcase of available NTF syntax.

=== Nuts Concepts


====  Nuts Concepts

`nuts` introduces a set of unique concepts that are important to leverage. These concepts are  mainly introduced for portability and repeatability.

== contributing


=== Building


To build`nuts` Package Management you need the following software installed on your machine:

* java JDK 8 (`nuts` is still compatible with java 8)


* maven 3.8+

* You favorite IDE (I'm using Netbeans and sometimes IntellijIdea and very sporadically Eclipse)

=====  Compiling Nuts

Here is the typical commands to get your own local copy of `nuts` sources and to compile them.

First of all, get your local copy of `nuts` source code from `github` 


[source,bash]
----

git clone https://github.com/thevpc/nuts.git
cd nuts

----

Then, you need to invoke `mvn install` to compile all of the project:


[source,bash]
----

mvn clean install

----

That being done, `nuts` will be compiled and installed to your local maven repository.

=====  Building Documentation and preparing development scripts

The next thing we need to worry about is the building of nuts community website and to have a working development version of `nuts` you can rely on in your tests manipulations.

To do so we will need to install locally `nuts` and `nsh`.

Assuming you are always under `nuts` repo root folder, issue the following command (its a bash command, so you need to be on linux or MacOS for it to work)


[source,bash]
----

cd installers/nuts-release-tool
java -jar target/nuts-release-tool-$version.jar

----

You can now play with your development version of nuts using the generated `nuts-dev` script. You may want to update the following line to match your java 8 JDK install location or simply add it to your shell `rcfile`.


[source,sh]
----

NUTS_JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0

----

Indeed, you must compile `nuts` with java 8 because nuts needs to be working on Java 8 and all later java versions ( this means that compiling on more recent versions of java should pass successfully as well). So you must not use deprecated features (in java9+) in nuts source code (examples : js nashorn, rmi activation, etc...)

=====  Running, testing and working with nuts-dev, in development environment

Here are some tips when working on nuts project or even working on an application that builds on `nuts` using NAF (aka Nuts Application Framework) for example:

* `nuts-dev` is the script you are most of the time using when developing `nuts` project.


* `nuts-dev` script uses a special workspace called `development`, so it does not interfere with your local `nuts` installation.


* you can always change the workspace in `nuts-dev` using `-w` option



[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev -w test

----

* You can run nuts in debug mode with `--debug` that shall be the very **FIRST** option. The following example will spawn a jvm listening on the 5005/tcp port you can attach to your favorite IDE.



[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev --debug

----

* Always make sure you are working on a clean workspace, to have a reproducible environment,


[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev -Zy

----

* If you are willing to run directly from your IDE, make sure you add `-w=development` or `-w=test` to   the program command line arguments as an example to work on a separate workspace than the one used in production or locally


* If you want to debug an application running under `nuts`, you can just debug `nuts` project using the embedded flag   ( `-b` or `--embedded`) to run that application in the same virtual machine



[source,sh]
----
 
nuts -w test -b my-app

----

* If you want to debug an application running under `nuts` in a separate virtual machine, use the option `--debug` option to run the application in debug mode listening to the 5005 tcp port, then attach it to your IDE. This will debug  `nuts` itself but will make possible running spawn jvm as well, the effective debugging port will be randomly selected and  displayed on your stdout. You will need to attach another jvm to your IDE using that port.



[source,sh]
----
 
nuts -w test --debug my-app
# or
nuts -w test --debug=5010 my-app

----

* When you need to have more information about what `nuts` is doing under the hood, just run it in verbose mode



[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev --verbose install some-application

----

* You may want to disable creation of shortcuts and desktop icons in development mode:


[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev --!init-launchers

----

* You may want to disable all repositories and use solely your local maven repo:


[source,sh]
----
 
./nuts-dev -r=maven-local

----

=== Contributing


=====  Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master   branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with   master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commIt's   correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* Don't put sub-module updates in your pull request unless they are to landed   commits.

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review   it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a   comment.

* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.

=====  How to contribute

You can contribute in a myriad of ways:

* submitting issues on [github issues corner](https://github.com/thevpc/nuts/issues) and adding any information you judge important for the maintainers.   please mark them with 'bug' label. `nuts` should make best effort to work on any environment. So if you encounter any malfunctioning, please contribute with submitting the issue. We are actually unable to test on all environments, so you really are our best hope!


* submitting a feature request again on [github issues corner](https://github.com/thevpc/nuts/issues)   please detail your idea and mark it with 'enhancement' label.

* working on existing issues. The issues are marked with labels. The priority is given always to the current version milestone (example 0.8.3).   The complexity of the issue is estimated with the `T-shirt sizing` approach: `size-xxs` is the simplest, `size-m` is medium sized and `size-xxl` is the more complex one.   Complexity is relative to both required time to do the task and experience on `nuts` project to do the work. So please start with smallest (simplest) issues.


* working on media and UX by submitting enhancements/replacements of existing website/icons/themes, etc...

* writing in press about nuts

=== Repository Structure


=====  Quick Lookup on sources organization

The repository is organized in several folders described here after:

* **[.dir-template]** : contains template files for generating `README.md` and `METADATA` (among other) files according to the current `nuts` development version


* **[core]**          : contains the core of `nuts` package manager (and the only required pieces for `nuts` to work). Practically this contains the Bootstrap (and API) project (called `nuts`) and the Runtime (Implementation) project (called `nuts-runtime`)


* **[docs]**          : contains a generated (using docusaurus) website that is deployed to github pages (https://thevpc.github.io/nuts/)


* **[extensions]**           : contains some `nuts` extensions/plugins. as an example it includes and extension for nuts terminal features implemented using `jline` library


* **[incubating]**    : ignore this for the moment :), It's a work in progress and an attempt to simplify `nuts` installation process and other frozen features. Still very embryonic.


* **[installers]**    : native image generators, gui installers and repository website generator goes here. 


* **[libraries]**           : contains a suite of libraries that are based on `nuts` and that can be used by other applications. This includes markdown parsers, ssh support, etc...


* **[test]**          : contains unit test projects


* **[companions]**    : contains a suite of applications that are tightly coupled with `nuts`. This includes `nsh` the shell companion


* **[third-party-companions]**    : contains a suite of third party wrapper applications. This includes `ndocusaurus` documentation generator


* **[toolbox]**       : contains a suite of applications that are based on `nuts` and that complement `nuts` features.


* **[web-toolbox]**   : contains a suite of web applications that are based on `nuts` and that complement `nuts` features. This includes `nwar`, a servlet implementation to serve `nuts` workspaces.


* **[documentation]** : contains the sources of `nuts`'s docusaurus based website and documentation files


** **[website/.dir-template]**       : contains the effective sources of `nuts`'s documentation (used to create the website as well). To be more precise, the website is built using a two steps process: first we pre-process the markdown files with template processing (using `ntemplate`) that will handle things like `nuts` version variables, documentation structure etc and hence prepare the `docusaurus` base folder. And then, we run `docusaurus` to generate the effective `html`/`js` for the statically compiled website.


=====  nuts projects

**`nuts`** repository is composed of several projects that can be organized in 5 categories

* **Core `nuts`** : These projects are the core/base of the **`nuts`** package manager


* **Companion Tools** : These projects are applications and tools to install with **`nuts`** itself. Their installation are prompted at first install of **nuts**

* **Toolbox** : These projects are applications and tools built on top of **`nuts`** Application Framework and are of common interest


* **Lib** : These projects are common libraries that can be used to enabled some **`nuts`** features in your application


* **Extension** : These projects are add features to the nuts platform. on example is the ability to add JLine library support to have smarter terminals.


* **Other** : All other apps that doe no fit in the previous categories


=====  Core Nuts projects

Core **`nuts`** projects include **nuts-builder**, **nuts-api** (/core/nuts), **nuts-runtime** (/core/nuts-runtime).

======  **nuts-builder**

**nuts-builder** is a meta project (parent maven pom project) that helps building all the other projects.

======  **nuts-api**

**nuts-api** is the effective "nuts" only required dependency.  It defines the bootstrap application that is responsible of loading all necessary libraries for its execution. 

**nuts-api** starts to load **nuts-runtime** which is responsible of implementing all features and interfaces declared by the **nuts-api** library.  That implementation will handle further download, version dependency etc. Such architecture is considered to force loose coupling with nuts binaries.

**nuts-api** is a very thin boostrapper : its size is about 300k. It can be used as a standalone application or as an embedded library.

======  **nuts-runtime**

**nuts-runtime** is the effective and standard implementation of **nuts-api**. 

**nuts-runtime** has a faster update pace than **nuts-api**.  It focuses on performance an compliance to the **nuts** specifications declared by **nuts-api** interfaces.  You are not required to add this dependency to your application if you want to embed **nuts**.  The library will be loaded on the wire (if not yet present in the classpath of course).

**nuts-runtime** is designed to have very few dependencies : **mslinks** and **jansi**. Both are supports/used only on windows platform. They wont be used on linux or MacOS 

* **mslinks** trivially is used to support windows shortcut menus


* **jansi** is used to support terminal coloring and the "Nuts Text Format" (NTF), a simple text format (markdown like) that helps creating colorful terminal applications.


=====  Companion tools projects

Companion tools include mainly **nsh**  This application is implemented following the "**`nuts`** Application Framework" and hence is dependent on **nuts-api** library.

**nsh** is a recommended for installation because it adds portable bash like features to the tool, however is is mandatory and may be ignored particularly when using **nuts-api** as library.

======  **nsh**

**nsh** (for **`nuts`** shell) is simply a portable POSIX bash compatible implementation.  It supports all common builtin commands (ls, cd, rm, ...) and adds support to grep, ssh and scp in a seamless manner.  It also supports command line, scripts (including commons constructs with if, do, case, ...), pipes (|) and common bash syntax.

=====  Toolbox projects

**`nuts`** comes with an array of tools out of the box you can install and play with. Here are some of them:

======  **nversion**

**nversion** is a small tool that helps detecting files versions.  It supports jar, war, ear, dll and exe file versions. It opens a file and looks for it's version in its meta-data.

======  **ndb**

**ndb** is a companion tool to the relational databased. **mysql**, **mariadb** and **nderby** servers are supported.  The main actions supported are backup and restore including push/pull mechanism from/to a couple of databases for synchronization.  It supports jdbc and ssh based access to remote mysql/mariadb installation.

======  **ntomcat**

**ntomcat** is a companion tool to the tomcat http server.  The main actions supported are start, stop, status, configure (http ports etc..) and deploy.  It supports as well installation of several versions of Tomcat and multi domain configuration for deployments.

======  **nmvn**

**nmvn** is a companion tool to maven.  It supports installations of several versions of maven and running them seamlessly.

======  **noapi**

**noapi** (for Nuts OpenApi) is an OpenAPI documentation generator.

======  **ncode**

**ncode** is a small code search tool. It searches for files, file contents and classes within jars. You can search for files than contains some text or jars that contain some class, or jars of a specific version of java.

======  **nwork**

**nwork** is a developer centered tool. **nwork** is the tool we - maven users - need to check if the version of project we are working on is yet to be deployed to nexus or not. So basically it checks if the version is the same, and downloads the server's version and then compares binaries to local project's to check if we have missed to update the version in our pom.xml. I know I'm not the only one having pain with jar deployments to nexus. **nwork** does other things as well to help me on on daily basis.

======  **ntemplate**

**ntemplate** is a file templating tool that replaces place-holders in the files with an evaluated expression. 

======  **njob**

**njob** is a powerful terminal todo list

======  **ndoc**

**ndoc** is a javadoc generator. It supports standard format and adds markdown format.

======  **ndocusaurus**

**ndocusaurus** is a [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io) toolbox that adds several features to the tool such as: 

* templating (using ntemplate)

* pdf generation

======  **ntalk-agent**

**ntalk-agent** is a client-to-client communication broker used for sharing **nuts** workspaces

======  **nclown**

**nclown** is an angular web application frontend for **`nuts`**. It helps navigating, searching and installing artifacts. It's intended to be a web admin tool as well.

======  **nserver**

**nserver** is a standalone application that runs a small http server that will expose a workspace as a remote repository to other **nuts** installations. This is the simplest way to mirror a workspace and share artifacts between networked nodes.

======  **nwar**

**nwar** (for **`nuts`** Web Application Archive) is a web application that exposes **nserver** as a war to be deployed on a more mature http server or container.

======  **ndexer**

**ndexer** (for Indexer) is a lucene powered index for **`nuts`**. It can be shared across multiple **`nuts`** workspaces and processes.

=====  Library Projects

Library projects are several libraries that add **`nuts`** support in a particular environment or domain.

======  **nlib-tomcat-classloader**

This is a must-have feature in your web application if deployed on Tomcat. It solves the following problem : a simple war application is surprisingly fat with too many jars (hundreds of Megas) you need to upload each time you change a single file or class in your web project. Basically all the jars included in the lib folder of the war are to be uploaded each time to the remote Tomcat server. The common solution is to use "provided" scope in maven and put your jars in Tomcat lib or ext folders. This is a bad approach if you are using a single Tomcat process for multiple applications. **nuts-tomcat-classloader** simply uses **nuts** to download libraries when the application is deployed based on the **pom.xml** you provide and include them in the current web application class loader. Hence, the war becomes lighter than ever. **nuts** cache mechanisms optimizes bandwidth and makes this more convenient by sharing the same jar files between applications depending on the same versions.  All you have to do is to add this library to your application and configure your **pom.xml** accordingly.

======  **nlib-servlet**

Basically this is the simplest way to include **nserver** into your web application.

======  **nlib-template**

This library provides helper methods to manipulate maven pom.xml and generate simple Java files while supporting **`nuts`** concepts. It's used in other tools that are meant to generate maven projects.

======  **nlib-talkagent**

This library provides support for client to client communication

=====  Extensions

Extensions provide extra feature to nuts.

======  **next-term**

This library provides rich terminal support (auto-complete, history) based on the JLine library

=====  Other Projects

Other projects you may encounter in the repository are WIP projects that may be continued or discontinued. This includes : **nutsc** (a native c bootstrapper) and **nuts-installer** (a **nuts** installer tool)

=====  Honorable mentions

Although not included in this Git repository some other tools are based on **`nuts`** and hence are installable using ` install the-app` command. Those tools are published in other repositories.

======  **netbeans-launcher** 

this tool supports installation and launch of multiple netbeans instances in parallel. See [Netbeans Launcher GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thevpc/netbeans-launcher)

======  **pnote**

this tool is a multi purpose, developer oriented, Note taking application. See [Pangaea Note](https://github.com/thevpc/pangaea-note)

======  **upa-box** (deprecated)

this tool supports creation of UPA aware projects. UPA is a non structured ORM for the Java Language. See [UPA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thevpc/upa)

======  **vr-box** (deprecated)

this tool supports creation of VR aware projects. VR is a web portal framework. See [VR GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thevpc/vr)

=== Command Line Arguments


**nuts** supports a specific format for command line arguments. This format is the format supported in **`nuts`** Application Framework (NAF) and as such all NAF applications support the same command line arguments format. Arguments in **`nuts`** can be options or non options. Options always start with hyphen (-). 

=====  Short vs Long Options

Options can be long options (starts with double hyphen) or short options (start with a single hyphen).  Many arguments support both forms. For instance "-w" and "--workspace" are the supported forms to define the workspace location in the nuts command.

=====  Valued / Non-valued Options

Options can also support a value of type string or boolean. The value can be suffixed to the option while separated with '=' sign or immediately after the option. 

As an example, all are equivalent.  


[source,sh]
----

nuts -w=/myfolder/myworkspace
nuts -w /myfolder/myworkspace
nuts --workspace /myfolder/myworkspace
nuts --workspace=/myfolder/myworkspace

----

Of course, not all options can support values, an not all options neither support the suffixed and/or the non-suffixed mode. Please relate to the documentation of nuts or the application you are using to know how to use the options.

=====  Boolean Options

Particularly, when the value is a boolean, the value do not need to be defined. As a result "--install-companions" and "--install-companions=true" are equivalent. However "--install-companions true" is not (because the option is of type boolean) and "true" will be parsed as a NonOption.

To define a "false" value to the boolean option we can either suffix with "=false" or prefix with "!" or "~" sign.  Hence, "--install-companions=false", "--!install-companions" and "--~install-companions" are all equivalent. Note also that `~` if referred to `!` because in bash shells (and som other shells) `!` will be expanded in a special manner.

=====  Combo Simple Options

Simple options can be grouped in a single word. "-ls" is equivalent to "-l -s". So one should be careful.  One exception though. For portability reasons, "-version" is considered a single short option.

=====  Ignoring Options, Comments

Options starting with "-//" and "--//" are simply ignored by the command line parser.

=====  Nuts Application Framework Default Options

All Applications inherit some default and useful options (see Nuts Command Line options for details). These options affect current session behaviour.

=====  Creating NCmdLine

Command line can either created manually or parsed.

You can create a command by simply providing  the arguments:


[source,java]
----

    NCmdLine c1= NCmdLine.of("ls","-l");

----

You can also create a commandline by parsing a string.

**nuts** supports multiple commandline dialects (bash/linux, bat/Windows,...)


[source,java]
----

    NCmdLine c1= NCmdLine.parse("ls -l", NShellFamily.BASH,session);

----

When you do not specify the NShellFamily, runtime OS default is considered.


[source,java]
----

    NCmdLine c1= NCmdLine.parse("ls -l", session);

----

You would want to be portable across all operating systems, you can use "parseDefault" method.


[source,java]
----

    NCmdLine c1= NCmdLine.parseDefault("ls -l");

----

=====  Using CommandLine


[source,java]
----

NCmdLine cmdLine = yourCommandLine();
boolean boolOption = false;
String stringOption = null;
List  others = new ArrayList<>();
NArg a;
while (cmdLine. hasNext()) {
  a = cmdLine. peek().get();
  if (a.isOption()) {
      switch (a.key()) {
          case "-o":
          case "--option": {
              a = cmdLine. nextFlag().get(session);
              if (a.isEnabled()) {
                  boolOption = a.getBooleanValue().get(session);
              }
              break;
          }
          case "-n":
          case "--name": {
              a = cmdLine.nextEntry().get(session);
              if (a.isEnabled()) {
                  stringOption = a.getStringValue().get(session);
              }
              break;
          }
          default: {
              session. configureLast(cmdLine);
          }
      }
  } else {
      others. add(cmdLine. next().get().toString());
  }
}
// test if application is running in exec mode
// (and not in autoComplete mode)
if (cmdLine. isExecMode()) {
  // do the good staff here
  session. out().println(NMsg. ofC("boolOption=%s stringOption=%s others=%s", boolOption, stringOption, others));
}

----

=====  Using CommandLine, The recommended way...


[source,java]
----

NCmdLine cmdLine = session. getCmdLine();
NRef<Boolean>  boolOption = NRef.of(false);
NRef<String>  stringOption = NRef.ofNull();
List<String>  others = new ArrayList<>();
cmdLine.forEachPeek ((a,l,c)-> {
  if (a.isOption()) {
      switch (a.key()) {
          case "-o":
          case "--option": {
              cmdLine.withNextFlag((v, e, s)->boolOption.set(v));
              return true;
          }
          case "-n":
          case "--name": {
              cmdLine.withNextEntry((v, e, s)->stringOption.set(v));
              return true;
          }
      }
      return false;
  } else {
      nonOptions.add(l.next().get().toString());
      return true;
  }
});

=== NOptional


**nuts** introduces a concept very similar to java's Optional but with better extension builtin mechanisms and helper methods : `NOptional``NOptional` is extensively used in Nuts Package Manager itself.

=====  Non Null Assertion

Java has a builtin null Check mechanism but it does not enable customized messages or exceptions. Optional are described as per Java's (c) Documentation "A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value". NOptional is more of an Object Wrapper than addes several useful null related operators like '??' '?.' and '!' in typescript. 



===== NAF


[source,java]
----
 
    NOptional.ofNamed(stringWord,"user name").get().toUpperCase();
    // will throw an IllegalArgumentException|NIllegalArgumentException with "missing user name" message;

----


===== Java


[source,java]
----

    if(stringWord==null){
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("missing user name");
    }
    stringWord.toUpperCase()

----

=== NPath


**nuts** introduces a concept very similar to java's URL but with better extension builtin mechanisms and helper methods : `NPath`supported formats/protocols are:

* file format   `/path/to/to/resource` or `\\\\path\\\\to\\\\resource`

* file URL `/path/to/to/resource` or `/path/to/resource`

* http/https URLs (or any other Java supported URL) `//some-url` or `//some-url`

* classpath `/path/to/to/resource` (you must provide the used classpath upon creation)


* resource Path `//groupId1:artifactId1#version1;groupId2:artifactId2#version2/path/to/resource` or `//(groupId1:artifactId1#version1;groupId2:artifactId2#version2)/path/to/resource` in that case the resource is looked up in any of the artifact classpaths (including dependencies)  


=== NStream


**nuts** introduces a concept very similar to java's Stream but with better extension builtin mechanisms and helper methods : `NStream``NStream` is actually a wrapper to java's Stream, Iterator and Iterable and you can create a stream using `.of(...)` methods.

`NStream` is extensively used in Search Command.
=== Nuts Application Framework


====  Using Nuts Application Framework (NAF)

Using `nuts` is transparent as we have seen so far. It's transparent both at build time and runtime. However, `nuts` can provide our application a set of unique helpful features, such as install and uninstall hooks, comprehensive command line support and so on.

To create your first `NAF` application, you will need to add nuts as a dependency and change your `pom.xml` as follows:


[source,xml]
----

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.thevpc.nuts</groupId>
            <artifactId>nuts-api</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.6</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jexcelapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>jxl</artifactId>
            <version>2.4.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
        <nuts.application>true</nuts.application>
    </properties>
</project> 

----

Please take note that we have added a property `nuts.application=true`.  Actually this is not mandatory, but this will help `nuts` package manager detect that this application uses NAF before downloading its jar (the information will be available in the `.xml` descriptor on the remote repository).

Then we will add some cool features to our application. We write a dummy message whenever the application is installed, uninstalled or updated. We will also add support to "--file=[path]" argument to specify the workbook path.


[source,java]
----

package com.mycompany.app;

import java.io.File;

import jxl.Workbook;
import jxl.write.WritableWorkbook;

public class App implements NApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // just create an instance and call runAndExit in the main method
        // this method ensures that exist code is well propagted
        // from exceptions to caller processes
        new App().run(NAppRunOptions.ofExit(args));
    }

    @Override
    public void run(NSession session) {
        NCmdLine cmd = session.getAppCmdLine();
        File file = new File("file.xls");
        while (cmd.hasNext()) {
            switch (cmd.getKey().getString()) {
                case "--file": {
                    NArg a = cmd.nextEntry().get();
                    file = new File(a.getStringValue());
                    break;
                }
                case "--fill": {
                    // process other options here ...
                    break;
                }
                default: {
                    s.configureLast(cmd);
                }
            }
        }
        try {
            WritableWorkbook w = Workbook.createWorkbook(file);
            s.out().printf("Workbook just created at %s%n", file);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace(s.err());
        }
    }

    @Override // this method is not required, implement when needed
    public void onInstallApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are installing My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }

    @Override // this method is not required, implement when needed
    public void onUninstallApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are uninstalling My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }

    @Override // this method is not required, implement when needed
    public void onUpdateApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are updating My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }
}


----

Now we can install or uninstall the application and see the expected messages.


[source,bash]
----

nuts -y install com.mycompany.app:my-app
nuts -y uninstall com.mycompany.app:my-app

----

Now we will add some dependencies to the project. Let's add `jexcelapi:jxl#2.4.2` and update `pom.xml` consequently.


[source,xml]
----

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jexcelapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>jxl</artifactId>
            <version>2.4.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
</project> 

----

Now we update the App.java file


[source,java]
----

package com.mycompany.app;

import java.io.File;

import jxl.Workbook;
import jxl.write.WritableWorkbook;

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            WritableWorkbook w = Workbook.createWorkbook(new File("any-file.xls"));
            System.out.println("Workbook just created");
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


----

finally we compile the app:


[source,bash]
----

mvn clean install

----

Of course, we won't be able to run the application yet. Would we? For this app to work there are several ways, all of them are complicated and require modifying the `pom.xml`  and even modifying the output jar. we can for instance generate an output lib directory and update the `META-INF` file using `maven-dependency-plugin`. (see https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin ; https://www.baeldung.com/executable-jar-with-maven). We could also use `maven-assembly-plugin` to include the dependencies into the jar itself ('what the fat' jar!). Another alternative is to use an uglier solution with `maven-shade-plugin` and blend libraries into the main jar. In all cases we need as well to configure `maven-jar-plugin` to specify the main class file.

I am not exposing all solutions here. You can read this article for more details (https://www.baeldung.com/executable-jar-with-maven) but trust me, they all stink.

Instead of that we will use `nuts`. In that case, actually we are already done, the app is already OK! We do not need to specify the main class neither are we required to bundle `jxl` and its dependencies. We only need to run the app. That's it.

Basically, you can install the application using its identifier `com.mycompany.app:my-app`. The latest version will be resolved.


[source,bash]
----

nuts install com.mycompany.app:my-app
nuts my-app

----

This will install the application and run it on the fly. Dependencies will be detected, resolved and downloaded. The application is installed from local maven repository. It needs to be deployed to a public repository for it to be publicly accessible, however.

We can also choose not to install the app and bundle it as a jar. No need for a public repository in that case:


[source,bash]
----

nuts -y com my-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

----

As we can see, `nuts` provides the simplest and the most elegant way to deploy your application.

One question though. what happens if we define multiple main methods (in multiple public classes). It's handled as well by `nuts` seamlessly. It just asks, at runtime, for the appropriate class to run.

====  Using Nuts Application Framework

Using `nuts` is transparent as we have seen so far. It's transparent both at build time and runtime. However, `nuts` can provide our application a set of unique helpful features, such as install and uninstall hooks, comprehensive command line support and so on.

To create your first `NAF` application, you will need to add nuts as a dependency and change your `pom.xml` as follows:


[source,xml]
----

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.thevpc.nuts</groupId>
            <artifactId>nuts-api</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.6</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jexcelapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>jxl</artifactId>
            <version>2.4.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
        <nuts.application>true</nuts.application>
    </properties>
</project> 

----

Please take note that we have added a property `nuts.application=true`.  Actually this is not mandatory, but this will help `nuts` package manager detect that this application uses NAF before downloading its jar (the information will be available in the `.xml` descriptor on the remote repository).

Then we will add some cool features to our application. We write a dummy message whenever the application is installed, uninstalled or updated. We will also add support to "--file=[path]" argument to specify the workbook path.


[source,java]
----

package com.mycompany.app;

import java.io.File;

import jxl.Workbook;
import jxl.write.WritableWorkbook;

public class App implements NApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // just create an instance and call runAndExit in the main method
        new App().run(NAppRunOptions.ofExit(args));
    }

    @Override
    public void run(NSession session) {
        NCmdLine cmd = session.getAppCmdLine();
        File file = new File("file.xls");
        while (cmd.hasNext()) {
            switch (cmd.getKey().getString()) {
                case "--file": {
                    NArg a = cmd.nextEntry().get();
                    file = new File(a.getStringValue());
                    break;
                }
                case "--fill": {
                    // process other options here ...
                    break;
                }
                default: {
                    s.configureLast(cmd);
                }
            }
        }
        try {
            WritableWorkbook w = Workbook.createWorkbook(file);
            s.out().printf("Workbook just created at %s%n", file);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace(s.err());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onInstallApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are installing My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }

    @Override
    public void onUninstallApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are uninstalling My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpdateApplication(NSession s) {
        s.out().printf("we are updating My Application : %s%n", s.getAppId());
    }
}


----

Now we can install or uninstall the application and see the expected messages.


[source,bash]
----

nuts -y install com.mycompany.app:my-app
nuts -y uninstall com.mycompany.app:my-app

----

=== Application Framework


`nuts` is a package manager that can be embedded in your application and hence present a solid Application Framework and tooling to make the applicable more robust and more portable.

== info


=== Running Nuts


=====  Running a deployed artifact

You can run any jar using **`nuts`** as far as the jar is accessible from one of the supported repositories. By default, **`nuts`** supports:

* maven central

* local maven folder (~/.m2)
You can configure other repositories or even implement your own if you need to.

The jar will be parsed to check form maven descriptor so that dependencies will be resolved and downloaded on the fly. Then, all executable classes (public with static void main method) are enumerated. You can actually run any of them when prompted. Any jar built using maven should be well described and can be run using its artifact long id.

=====  Artifact Long Ids

**`nuts`** long ids are a string representation of a unique identifier of the artifact. It has the following form :


[source,bash]
----

groupId:artifactId#version

----

for instance, to install `netbeans-launcher` (which is a simple UI helping launch of multiple instances of netbeans), you can issue


[source,bash]
----

  nuts net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

You do agree that this can be of some cumbersome to type. So you can simplify it to :


[source,bash]
----

  nuts netbeans-launcher

----

In this form, **`nuts`** will auto-detect both the `groupId` and the `version`. The group id is detected if It's already imported (we will see later how to import a groupId).  By default, there is a couple of groupIds that are automatically imported :

* `.thevpc` (contains various applications of the author)


* `.thevpc.nuts.toolbox` (contains various companion tools of **`nuts`**, such as `nsh`, ...)


And it turns out, hopefully, that netbeans-launcher belongs to an imported groupId, so we can omit it. Besides, if no version is provided, **`nuts`** will also auto-detect the best version to execute. If the application is already installed, the version you choose to install will be resolved. If you have not installed any, the most recent version, obviously, will be detected for you.

=====  Artifact Installation

Any java application can run using **`nuts`** but it has to be installed first. If you try to run the application before installing it, you will be prompted to confirm installation. To install our favorite application here we could have issued :


[source,bash]
----

  nuts install netbeans-launcher

----

But as we have tried to run the application first, it has been installed for us (after confirmation).

=====  Multiple Artifact version Installation

One of the key features of **`nuts`** is the ability to install multiple versions of the same application. We can for instance type :


[source,bash]
----

  nuts install netbeans-launcher#1.2.2
  # then
  nuts install netbeans-launcher#1.2.0

----

Now we have two versions installed, the last one always is considered default one. you can run either, using it's version


[source,bash]
----

  nuts netbeans-launcher#1.2.2 &
  # or
  nuts netbeans-launcher#1.2.0 &

----

Actually, when you have many versions installed for the same artifact and you try to run it without specifying the version, the last one installed will be considered. To be more precise, an artifact has a default version when It's installed. This default version is considered when no explicit version is typed. In our example, when we type


[source]
----

  nuts netbeans-launcher &

----

the 1.2.0 version will be invoked because the artifact is already installed and the default version points to the last one installed. So if you want to switch back to version 1.2.2 you just have to re-install it. Don't worry, no file will be downloaded again, nuts will detect that the version is not marked as default and will switch it to.

=====  Searching artifacts

Now let's take a look at installed artifacts. We will type :


[source,bash]
----

  nuts search --installed

----

This will list all installed artifacts. We can get a better listing using long format :


[source,bash]
----

  nuts search --installed -l

----

you will see something like


[source]
----

I-X 2019-08-21 04:54:22.951 anonymous vpc-public-maven net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.0
i-X 2019-08-21 04:54:05.196 anonymous vpc-public-maven net.thevpc.app:netbeans-launcher#1.2.2

----

The first column here is a the artifact status that helps getting zipped information of the artifact. the 'I' stands for 'installed and default' whereas, 'i' is simply 'installed'. The 'X' stands for 'executable application', where 'x' is simply 'executable'. Roughly said, executable applications are executables aware of (or depends on) **nuts**, as they provide a special api that helps nuts to get more information and more features for the application. As an example, executable applications have special OnInstall and OnUninstall hooks called by nuts. The second and the third columns are date and time of installation. The fourth column points to the installation user. When Secure mode has not been enabled (which is the default), you are running nuts as 'anonymous'. The fifth column shows the repository from which the package was installed. And the last column depicts the artifact long id.

=====  Running local jar file with its dependencies

Let's suppose that my-app.jar is a maven created jar (contains META-INF/maven files) with a number of dependencies. **`nuts`** is able to download on the fly needed dependencies, detect the Main class (no need for MANIFEST.MF) and run the  application. If a Main-Class Attribute was detected in a valid MANIFEST.MF, il will be considered. If more than one class is detected with a main method, **`nuts`** will ask for the current class to run.

When you run a local file, **`nuts`** will behave as if the app is installed (in the given path, an no need to invoke install command). Local files are detected if they are denoted by a valid path (containing '/' or '' depending on the underlying operating system). Dependencies will be downloaded as well (and cached in the workspace)


[source,bash]
----

nuts ./my-app.jar some-argument-of-my-app

----

If you need to pass JVM arguments you have to prefix them with "--exec". So if you want to fix maximum heap size use 


[source,bash]
----

nuts --exec -Xms1G -Xmx2G ./my-app.jar argument-1 argument-2

----

=== Getting Started


In this section we will consider the simplest usage of `nuts` package manager.
=== Frequently Asked Questions


=====  Why not maven?

or, "Why do we need a package manager for Java. Isn't **Maven** enough?".

Please read [Nuts Introduction, Why and What for](../intro/nuts-and-maven.md). In few words maven manages dependencies to build applications, nuts uses maven dependencies system to install applications.

=====  What does Nuts mean and why ?

**`nuts`** stands for "Network Updatable Things Services". It helps managing things (artifacts of any type, not only java). The Name also helps depicting another idea : **`nuts`** is a good companion and complement to Maven tool.  The word maven (MAY-vin), from Yiddish, means a super-enthusiastic expert/fan/connoisseur/Wizard. And where wizards are, fools and **`nuts`** must be. 

**`nuts`** is the foolish tool to support the deployment and not the build.  Hence the name.

=====  Does nuts support only jar packaging

Not only. **`nuts`** supports all types of packaging, particularly, those supported by maven.  This includes  pom , jar , maven-plugin , ejb , war , ear , rar.

**`nuts`** is also intended to support any "thing" including "exe" ,"dll", "so", "zip" files, etc.

**`nuts`** differs from maven as it defines other properties to the artifact descriptor (aka pom in maven) : os (operating system), arch (hardware architecture), osdist (relevant for linux for instance : opensuse, ubuntu) and platform (relevant to vm platforms like java vm, dotnet clr, etc). Such properties are queried to download the most appropriate binaries for the the current environment.

=====  Can I contribute to the project

I hoped you would ask this question. Of course.  You can drop me an email (see my github profile email) to add you as contributor or fork the repository and ping a pull request.  You can also open a new issue for feature implementation to invite any other contributor to implement that feature (or even implement it your self).

=====  Where can I find Documentation about the Project

Mainly all of the documentation can be found in 2 places:

* this website: it includes both user documentation and javadocs (code documentation)

* each command help option. when you type 


[source,sh]
----
 
  nuts --help
  
----

    or 


  

[source,sh]
----
 
  nsh --help
  
----

 

  you will get more details on nuts or on the tool (here nsh)

=====  How can I make my application "Nuts aware"

If by **`nuts`** aware you mean that you would download your application and run it using **`nuts`**, then you just need to create the application using maven and deploy your application to the public maven central. Nothing really special is to be done from your side. You do not have to use plugins like 'maven-assembly-plugin' and 'maven-shade-plugin' to include your dependencies. Or, you can also use NAF (**`nuts`** Application Framework) to make your application full featured "Nuts aware" application.

=====  Why Nuts Application Framework (NAF)

or, "Why should I consider implementing my terminal application using Nuts Application Framework (NAF)?" First of all, NAF is a simple 300k jar so for what it provided to you, you would be surprised.  Indeed, implementing your application using NAF will provide you a clean way to :

* seamless integration with **`nuts`** and all other NAF applications (obviously!)


* support standard file system layout (XDG) where config files and log files are not necessarily in the same folder see [Nuts File System](../concepts/filesystem.md) for more details.

* support application life cycle events (onInstall, onUninstall, onUpdate), 

* standard support of command line arguments

* dynamic dependency aware class loading

* terminal coloring, and terminal components (progress bar, etc...)

* json, yaml, xml, table, tree and plain format support out of the box as output to all your commands

* pipe manipulation when calling sub processes

* advanced io features (persistence Locks, monitored downloads, compression, file hashing....)

* standard ways to support and use installed platforms (installed JRE, JDK, ...)

* and lots more...

=====  Can I use NAF for non terminal applications, Swing or JavaFX perhaps

Sure, you will be able to benefit of all the items in the preceding question but terminal coloring wont be relevant of course.  Check netbeans-launcher in github. It's a good example of how interesting is to use NAF in non terminal applications. 

=====  What is the License used in Nuts

**`nuts`** is published under Licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.   

=== Troubleshooting


Whenever installation fails, It's more likely there is a mis-configuration or invalid libraries bundles used. You may have to options to circumvent this which are two levels or workspace reinitialization.

=====  recover mode

**recover mode** will apply best efforts to correct configuration without losing them. It will delete all cached data and  libraries for them to be downloaded later and searches for a valid nuts installation binaries to run (it will actually  do a forced update). To run nuts in recover mode type :


[source]
----

nuts -z

----

=====  newer mode

**newer mode** will apply best efforts to reload cached files and libraries. to run nuts in 'newer mode' type:


[source]
----

nuts -N

----

=====  reset mode

**reset mode** will apply all efforts to correct configuration by, actually, **deleting** them  (and all of workspace files!!) to create a new fresh workspace. This is quite a radical action to run. Do not ever invoke this unless your are really knowing what you are doing.  To run nuts in reset mode type :


[source]
----

nuts -Z

----

=====  kill mode

**kill mode** is a special variant of reset mode where workspace will not be recreated after deletion.  This can be achieved by using a combination of reset mode and --skip-boot (-Q) option. Do not ever invoke it unless you are really knowing what you are doing. To run nuts in kill mode type :

To run nuts in kill mode type :


[source]
----

nuts -ZQ

----

=====  After invoking reset mode

After invoking reset mode, nuts shell launchers (installed by nuts settings) will not be available anymore.  PATH environment will point (temporarily) to a non existing folder. You should use the jar based invocation at least once to reinstall these commands.

=== Installation


`nuts` is a package manager for the Java Platform. Basically, It's what npm is for Javascript and pip for Python. However, `nuts` presents several concepts that make it suitable for other technologies as well.
=== Tutorial


=====  GUI Installation

You can install `nuts` using a gui installer. Multiple targets are available. You may select a portable installer (a jar that you can double click as far as you have a valid java+ runtime installed and configured in your environment). You may also want to select a native image for the installer; you only need to download and run.

image:../static/img/installer/00.png[install-log-example]Once you launch the installer, you will be prompted first to select your favourite look : light mode or dark mode. This will customize the look of all the remaining steps.

image:../static/img/installer/01-li.png[install-log-example]Then, a description message is shown.image:../static/img/installer/02-li.png[install-log-example]In the next step, you are asked to accept the OSS licence.image:../static/img/installer/03-li.png[install-log-example]`nuts` comes with a dual version, stable and preview. Stable version is recommended in most cases. But if you want to take advantage of new features not yet released you may want to install the preview version.

image:../static/img/installer/04-li.png[install-log-example]The installer will even prompt you for selecting extra java applications you may want to install along with `nuts`. The only recommended apps are already selected and marked as `Companions`. This includes mostly `nsh`, a bash compatible implementation in Java.

image:../static/img/installer/05-li.png[install-log-example]Then, you may want to tune some nuts options. Please note that by default, any existing workspace will be erased. So if you want to preserve you older installation, deselect "Reset Workspace (-Z)". "Verbose" and "Log file" are also good options to consider if some thing odd occurs during the installation process. This will leverage more debug messages to be printed and stored to log files you attach when contacting the dev team.

image:../static/img/installer/06-li.png[install-log-example]Now the effective installation starts. You will see the progress in a colourful terminal.image:../static/img/installer/07-li.png[install-log-example]And voilà! you now have reached the installation end. Just click on Exit.image:../static/img/installer/08-li.png[install-log-example]If you check your system menu, you will notice some new icons, including a `nuts aware` terminal. On Linux and MacOs, you do not need such menu to run you favorite nuts command though. The Installer has already configured your shell rc files to include nuts in the execution `PATH` env variable.

Here is and example af your menu when using Enlightenment Desktop Environment on Linux

=====  Dark Mode

You may have chosen the Dark mode of course, and you would have crossed the following steps:

=====  Your first commands

After installation, open any nuts `aware terminal` (on linux, any bash,zsh,fish,... terminal is ok).

=== Installation in Production


Installation of `nuts` in production is based on stable `nuts` binaries that are released according to a semi-annual schedule. Stable versions are deployed to maven-central and hence are made accessible very easily to all users. Releases include most of the time updates to the core nuts api (and bootstrap). Update/Fix releases can occur to fix blocking/serious/security issues is faster pace.

=====  System Requirements

Here are all **`nuts`** requirements :

* **Java** : **`nuts`** requires a valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version **8** or above to execute. Please note that you need to update your 1.8 version to the latest update (update 150+)


* **System Memory**: **`nuts`** memory footprint is very little and has no minimum RAM requirements.


* **Disk**: 5Mo on the disk are required for the **`nuts`** installation itself. In addition to that, additional disk space will be used for your local Nuts workspace. The size of your local workspace will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.


* **Operating System**: **`nuts`** is able to run on any java enabled Operating System including all recent versions of Windows, Linux and MacOS.


To check if you have a valid java installation type


[source,bash]
----

java -version

    0.8.3/nuts-0.8.3.jar -o nuts.jar
$ java -jar nuts.jar -Zy
$ exit

----

Linux Systems installation is based on bash shell. First launch will configure "~/.bashrc" so that **nuts** and other companion tool commands will be available in any future terminal instances. Note that shells are also supported and the relative `rcfiles` are also updated (including `zsh`, `fish` etc) Using **`nuts`** on unix-like system should be seamless. A simple bash terminal (Gnome Terminal, KDE Konsole,...) is already a nuts-aware terminal.

All Linux versions and distributions should work with or without X Window (or equivalent). Graphical system is required only if you plan to run a gui application using **nuts**. All tests where performed on OpenSuse Tumbleweed.


TIP: 

Any bash terminal application is a nuts-aware terminal.



===== MacOS

On Windows systems, first launch will create a new **`nuts`** Menu (under Programs) and a couple of Desktop shortcuts to launch a configured command terminal.

- **nuts-cmd-0.8.5** : this shortcut will open a configured command terminal. **`nuts`** command will be available as well as several nuts companion tools installed by **nadmin** by default

- **nuts-cmd**       : this shortcut will point to the last installed **nuts** version, here 0.8.5  

Any of these shortcuts will launch a nuts-aware terminal.

Supported Windows systems include Window 7 and later.


TIP: 

Any of the created shortcuts for windows is a nuts-aware terminal.

=== Installation (Preview Mode)


Installation of `nuts` for preview/test/evaluation or simply for personal use is based on a rolling `nuts` binaries version that is released a faster pace than the production version (generally a semi-monthly schedule). Versions are not rock solid but still they are "very" usable and more importantly they include all latest features. Preview releases are deployed to a development repository and hence are made accessible using a repository swith option.

=====  System Requirements

Here are all **`nuts`** requirements :

* **Java** : **`nuts`** requires a valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version **8** or above to execute. Please note that you need to update your 1.8 version to the latest update (update 150+)

== intro


=== Introduction


`nuts` is a package manager for the Java Platform. Basically, It's what npm is for Javascript and pip for Python. However, `nuts` presents several concepts that make it suitable for other technologies as well.
=== Introduction


**`nuts`** stands for **Network Updatable Things Services** tool and is a portable package manager for java (mainly) that handles remote artifacts, installs these artifacts to the current machine and executes such artifacts on need.

**`nuts`** solves the **fatjar** problem delegating the dependency resolution to the time when the application is to be executed and simplifies the packaging process while being transparent to the build process. Actually, nuts uses **maven** **pom** descriptors to resolve dependencies when the artifact is installed on the target machine, and it can use also other types of descriptors for other types of packages.

**`nuts`** artifacts are  stored  into repositories. A  **repository**  may be local for  storing local artifacts or remote for accessing remote artifacts (good examples  are  remote maven  repositories). It may also be a proxy repository so that remote artifacts are fetched and cached locally to save network resources.

One manages a set of repositories called a  workspace (like **virtualenv** in **`pip`**). Managed **`nuts`**  (artifacts)  have descriptors that depicts dependencies between them. This dependency is seamlessly handled by  **`nuts`**  (tool) to resolve and download on-need dependencies over the wire.

**`nuts`** is a swiss army knife tool as it acts like (and supports) **maven** build tool to have an abstract view of the artifacts dependency and like  **npm** and **pip** language package managers to  install and uninstall artifacts allowing multiple versions of the very same artifact to  be installed. **`nuts`** is not exclusive for Java/Scala/Kotlin and other Java Platform Languages, by design it supports multiple artifact formats other than jars and wars and is able to select the appropriate artifacts and dependencies according to the current OS, architecture and even Desktop Environment.

**`nuts`** common verbs are:

* `exec`               : execute an artifact or a command


* `which`              : detect the proper artifact or system command to execute


* `install`, `uninstall` : install/uninstall an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)


* `update`,`check-updates`  : search for updates


* `deploy`, `undeploy`   : manage artifacts (artifact installers) on the local repositories


* `fetch`, `push`        : download from, upload to remote repositories


* `search`             : search for existing/installable artifacts


* `welcome`            : a command that does nothing but bootstrapping **`nuts`** and showing a welcome message.

=== Nuts and Maven


=====  You'd still be Maven, yet you gonna be Nuts

Is there any package manager for Java(TM) applications? You can google for it and you will find that many have  queried this on blogs and forums. In most cases responses point to maven and gradle, the tremendous build tools. However,  both maven and gradle are build tools, while helping build packages they lack of deployment features. They bundle every  dependency in every package (think of wars, ears and standalone jars). They do not handle installation or upgrading. Apache ivy, as well, while competing with maven build tool does not provide more than transitive dependency management.    The main idea behind a package manager is the automation of installation, update, configuration and removal of programs  or libraries in a coherent manner with the help of a database that manages binaries and metadata. maven, to consider one,  sticks to the build process, an goes no further.

You may also ask, "Why ever, do we need a package manager for Java(TM) applications". Okkay, let's take some  example of Java(TM) applications. How can we install apache netbeans IDE ? The proper way is to browse to the editor's  website, select the proper mirror if applicable, download the archive, uncompress it, chmod the main binary (i'm a linux  guy) and adjust PATH environment variable to point to this binary; Quite a pain. What do we do to update it now? Hopefully, the IDE has a solid plugin architecture and an in-app update/upgrade tool that will help the process (in a gui manner of course). The same applies to eclipse and apache tomcat with the exception that apache tomcat does not even bundle an in-app update tool. The same applies too when dealing with other operating systems (Windows, MacOS, ...). Managing Java(TM) applications is far from helpful.

Furthermore, as Java(TM) applications are (usually) not bundled in OS-aware installers, you will end up with a spaguetty  home directory with applications installed all over your partitions, which - simply - does not mix up with all the work  OS-developers have done to separate logs from data, from temporary files, from binaries, etc. Each application will handle it's files in a very specific manner that would make it hard to manage own's disk (automatic archive/backup/restore) or roaming applications across machines, etc.

Moreover, in a world of containers and devops, deployments of Java(TM) applications need to be automatable and reproducible  with the highest level of simplicity, configurability and integrability. Installing tomcat on a custom port should not not  be as painful as using a custom Docker image or a complicated Dockerfile or even a custom apache tomcat bundle. 

When we recall that Java(TM) is the one language that has the more versatile number of libraries, frameworks and tools,  I find it annoying not to have a decent package manager to make the leap and provide facilities I find prime in other  languages and platforms (`pip`/`python`, `npm`/`nodejs`/`javascript`) and most of linux distribution (`zypper`/`opensuse`, `dnf`/`redhat` `apt-get`/`debian`/`ubuntu`)

Hence I'm introducing here a humble attempt to provide a tiny (300ko) yet powerful package manager for Java(TM)  applications (but not only) that should handle jar files seamlessly (with little or no modification) and that comes with  a set of portable tools that makes this management at a higher level. I'm not talking about redefining the wheel.  I'm aware that many tools such as maven, are already very good at what they do, I just needed to make the leap for deployments.  You will be able to deploy your applications without bundling all of their dependencies : **`nuts`** will take care of that. 

So you'd still be maven, yet you gonna be **`nuts`**.

  

=====  Nuts Package manager

**`nuts`** is actually :

* a transitive dependency resolution manager

* a package manager (backports maven and supports maven repositories)

* an automation tool

* a feature rich toolset

* an application framework

* decentralized

* sandbox based

======  Transitive dependency resolution manager

**`nuts`** calculates transitive dependencies of an application to resolve other packages to download at install or  update/upgrade time. So typically, deployed applications should no more bundle their dependencies within the deployed archive. Thus we avoid the annoying fat jars (using maven plugins like 'maven-assembly-plugin' and 'maven-shade-plugin') and lib folders  (using 'maven-dependency-plugin'). It will also reuse dependencies and packages across multiple installed applications  and hence save disk space, and network bandwidth.

All what **`nuts`** needs is a descriptor file withing the jar file that defines the immediate dependencies. It then  calculates all transitive dependencies automatically. And guess what, all maven built jars already contain that  descriptor : the pom.xml file. So basically all maven applications are already **`nuts`** aware applications.

======  Package manager

**`nuts`** uses this dependency resolution to help install, update, remove and search for applications. To be able to use an  application, it has to be installed and configured with all of its dependencies. This is the main goal of **`nuts`**. When we ask to install tomcat, for instance, it will search for the best version in registered repositories, download it, and configure it to be ready for execution. The best version is not always the the latest one. Actually it would be the  latest valid one, thus the latest one that matches some constraints.   Constraints include the version of the running java (tomcat 8 works on java 7 but not 6 for instance), the running operating  system (windows, linux, ... to help selecting the proper binaries), may be the hardware architecture or even the  operating distribution (for linux based systems). Constraints will filter the search result to include the best, the most  accurate version to install. Installation also would configure the installed application and even may run another  artifact to help this configuration.

**`nuts`** also handles search for newer versions and update the installed application at request. Updating a software does not  necessarily delete the older version. Both version can coexist and It's up to the user the decide whether or  not to retain both versions. Indeed, one of the key features of **`nuts`** is the ability to install and hence run multiple versions  of the same software in parallel. You would never see an error message telling you can't install that software because a  dependency of It's installed with different version. All software and all libraries can coexist peacefully.

Software artifacts are stored in repositories. **`nuts`** can handle multiple repositories, remote and local ones.  Installed software are stored in special local repositories. Supported repositories include maven repositories and github  repositories. Actually a fresh installation of **`nuts`** is configured with maven central repository so that, you already have access  to thousands of installable artifacts.

At some point, you may need to uninstall an artifact and that's to undo the artifact installation.   Installation will help you choose between uninstalling binaries only and keeping data/config files or remove permanently  all of the artifact files. In all ways, uninstalling will not affect other artifacts that use the same dependencies if ever. 

 

======  Feature rich Toolset

**`nuts`** is intended to be used either by human users or by robots and other applications. It comes with portable, feature rich toolset, a versatile library and a handy parsable result. 

**`nuts`** is mainly a commandline program that helps installing, uninstalling, searching, updating and running artifacts.  To help desktop integration, **`nuts`** installs by default a set of other companion tools such as `nsh` (a portable  bash-compatible implementation), and `nadmin` (an administration tool for **`nuts`** to configure users, authorizations, repositories,  create scripts,...);

**nsh** brings the bash  facilities to all environments (windows included) in a very portable manner. Besides it integrates well with the installed **`nuts`** version. Several common commands are ported to `nsh` such as `cat`,`head`, and `ssh`,  as well as core features like pipes, redirection and scripts. 

**nadmin** is intended for configuring **`nuts`** workspaces, managing repositories and users. It helps also configuring  sub commands and aliases to make **`nuts`** usage even easier.

=====  Nuts Workspaces

One of the key features of **`nuts`** is the ability to support multiple isolated workspaces, each managing it's own  repositories, applications and libraries; each defining it's sandbox security constraints. Thus non-root installation is made easy while it remains possible to overlap between workspaces by sharing repositories. Roaming is also supported, so that a workspaces can be copied/moved across machines.

=====  Application Framework

**nuts** can also be embedded as a library in you application. This enables you to wire classes on the fly by its network  dependency-aware classloading mechanisms. The library allows as well building solid and well integrated applications,  mainly console applications. Indeed, `nuts` comes with rich outputs that support automatic formatting to json, xml, table,  tree and plain texts. It handles standard File Systems layouts; XDG Base Directory Specification is implemented  for linux and MacOS. A compatible one is also implemented in Windows systems. And of course, it helps seamlessly install, update and remove events. 

=====  Nuts ? Really ?

In every palace you will find the wizard and the fool, the **`maven`** and the **`nuts`**; There's no  exception in the java kingdom! If you do prefer acronyms here is another reason : **`nuts`** stands for Network  Updatable Things Services. It should be able to facilitate things deployment and update over the  wire where things resolve here to any piece of software depending (or not) on other piece of software.

=====  Let's start the journey

we start by opening a new terminal (termm, konsole or whatever you prefer) then download **`nuts`** using this command :  On linux/MacOS system we issue :


[source]
----

wget https://github.com/thevpc/vpc-public-maven/raw/master/net/vpc/app/nuts/nuts/0.8.5/nuts-0.8.5.jar

----

Let's check that java is installed :


[source]
----

java --version

----

Now we run **`nuts`**

[source]
----

java -jar nuts-0.8.5.jar -zy

----

We used the flags `-y` to auto-confirm and `-z` to ignore cached binaries (combined here as `-zy`).  These flags are not required. We use them here to make installation work in all cases. Installation may last several minutes as it will download all required dependencies, companions and tools.

You should then see this message


[source]
----

Welcome to nuts. Yeah, It's working...

----

**`nuts`** is well installed, just restart your terminal.

Now we will install apache tomcat. So in your terminal type:


[source]
----

nuts install ntomcat
nuts ntomcat start --set-port 9090

----

The first two commands will install tomcat helper tool (ntomcat) that will download latest version of tomcat and configure it to 9090 port. The last command will start tomcat. Let's check tomcat status now


[source]
----

nuts tomcat status

----

Now we will do the same with derby database. We will install it and run it.


[source]
----

nuts install nderby
nuts nderby start

----

As you can see, simple commands are all you need to download, install, configure and run tomcat or derby or any application that is deployed in the maven repository.
