**nuts** introduces a concept very similar to java's Stream but with better extension builtin mechanisms and helper methods : ```NutsStream```

```NutsStream``` is actually a wrapper to java's Stream, Iterator and Iterable and you can create a stream using ```NutsStream.of(...)``` methods.

```NutsStream``` is extensively used in Search Command.
