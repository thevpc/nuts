## Changes
### Several Refactoring
v0.8.9 is major version.
It may break your existing code (<=v0.8.8). Use it with care.

### Better security support
- New more secure implementation of cipher using AES/GCM instead of older and broken DES/CBC
- Enhanced types support with new order and unordered lists, Bloc Strings, grouped Multiline comments, etc.
- added NSecureToken : a better way to support external Vaults
- added NSecureString : a better way to support destroyable secrets

### TSON v2.0
- Nuts becomes the reference implementation of TSON
- Enhanced types support with new expressions, order and unordered lists, bloc Strings, grouped multiline comments, etc.
- Round-trip parser that preserves not only comments but also spaces in a CST (Concrete Syntax Tree)
- Never fail parser/writer that stores errors as diagnostic information in the CST
- Added User Metadata support (enhance any element with user data)
- Added better navigation concepts : NElementPath, NElementNavigator
- Added better AST/CST transformation concepts : NElementTransform, NElementFormatter

### Enhanced performance
- Parallel dependency resolution
- Faster ssh connexions with pooling
- Faster Bean Factory
- Added NPath::getInfo, listInfos that return a full NPathInfo for performance
- Added cache to Exec to store command classpath, no need to rebuild classpath

### Support for non pure java artifacts
- Added support to download JDK/JRE
- Added support to download Tomcat
- Added support to download Netbeans
- Added support to download PostgreSQL server (portable installation)

### Integration
- Added Gradle Dependency Solver
- Support customizing common editors syntax highlighting (including but not limited to : vim, intellij, kate, vscode, gedit, jEdit, notepad++)
- Normalized environment resolution across local, ssh etc
- Better support for ssh for remote Windows machines
- Better support for ssh for remote linux/posix machines
- Added support for binary ssh (ssh://myuser@myserver?use=bin vs ssh://myuser@myserver?use=jcsh vs ssh://myuser@myserver?use=portable)
- Added NExecCmd::get/setRawCommand to enable complex commands
- Autodetect docker environment
- Autodetect kubernetes environment
- NPathOption now can include access credentials

### Fixes
- Fixed Progress display
