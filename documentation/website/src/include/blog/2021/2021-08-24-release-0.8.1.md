- ADDED  : ```runtime``` added fast implementation for JSON and removed gson dependency
- CHANGED: ```runtime``` revamped Nuts Text Format to support simplified syntax but more verbose styles.

  nlib-talk-agent is a broker that helps communication between nuts components with minimum overhead.
  nlib-talk-agent enables one workspace to talk with any other workspace without having to create one server socket for each workspace.
  It also enables singleton per location implementation
