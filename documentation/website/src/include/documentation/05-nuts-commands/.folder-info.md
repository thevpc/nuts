+ ```exec```               : execute an artifact or a command
+ ```which```              : detect the proper artifact or system command to execute
+ ```install```, ```uninstall``` : install/uninstall an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)
+ ```update```,```check-updates```  : search for updates
+ ```deploy```, ```undeploy```   : manage artifacts (artifact installers) on the local repositories
+ ```fetch```, ```push```        : download from, upload to remote repositories
+ ```search```             : search for existing/installable artifacts
+ ```welcome```            : a command that does nothing but bootstrapping **```nuts```** and showing a welcome message.
