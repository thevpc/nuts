title: Can I use NAF for non terminal applications, Swing or JavaFX perhaps

Sure, you will be able to benefit of all the items in the preceding question but terminal coloring wont be relevant of course. 
Check netbeans-launcher in github. It's a good example of how interesting is to use NAF in non terminal applications.
