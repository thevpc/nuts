## What does Nuts mean and why ?
**```nuts```** stands for "Network Updatable Things Services". It helps managing things (artifacts of any type, not only java).
The Name also helps depicting another idea : **```nuts```** is a good companion and complement to Maven tool. 
The word maven (MAY-vin), from Yiddish, means a super-enthusiastic expert/fan/connoisseur/Wizard.
And where wizards are, fools and **```nuts```** must be. 
**```nuts```** is the foolish tool to support the deployment and not the build. 
Hence the name.
