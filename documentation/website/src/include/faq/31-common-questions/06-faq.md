title: Where can I find Documentation about the Project
---

Mainly all of the documentation can be found in 2 places:

* this website: it includes both user documentation and javadocs (code documentation)
* each command help option. when you type

```sh 
  nuts --help
  ``` 

or

  ```sh 
  nsh help
  ``` 

you will get more details on nuts or on the tool (here nsh)
