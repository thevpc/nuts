title: Can I contribute to the project
---

## 
I hoped you would ask this question. Of course. 
You can drop me an email (see my github profile email) to add you as contributor or fork the repository and ping a pull request. 
You can also open a new issue for feature implementation to invite any other contributor to implement that feature (or even implement it your self).
