On Windows systems, first launch will create a new **```nuts```** Menu (under Programs) and a couple of Desktop shortcuts to launch a configured command terminal.
- **nuts-cmd-{{apiVersion}}** : this shortcut will open a configured command terminal. **```nuts```** command will be available as well as several nuts companion tools installed by **nadmin** by default
- **nuts-cmd**       : this shortcut will point to the last installed **nuts** version, here {{apiVersion}}

Any of these shortcuts will launch a nuts-aware terminal.

Supported Windows systems include Window 7 and later.

:::tip

Any of the created shortcuts for windows is a nuts-aware terminal.

__(using wget):__
This will reuse any previous nuts installation before installing the latest version.

```
$ wget https://thevpc.net/nuts/nuts-stable.jar -qO nuts.jar
$ java -jar nuts.jar -y
$ exit
```

__(using curl):__
This will reuse any previous nuts installation before installing the latest version.

```
$ curl -sL https://thevpc.net/nuts/nuts-stable.jar -o nuts.jar
$ java -jar nuts.jar -Zy
$ exit
```

Linux Systems installation is based on bash shell. First launch will configure "~/.bashrc" so that **nuts** and other companion tool commands will be available in any future terminal instances. Note that shells are also supported and the relative `rcfiles` are also updated (including `zsh`, `fish` etc)
Using **```nuts```** on unix-like system should be seamless. A simple bash terminal (Gnome Terminal, KDE Konsole,...) is already a nuts-aware terminal.

All Linux versions and distributions should work with or without X Window (or equivalent). Graphical system is required only if you plan to run a gui application using **nuts**.
All tests where performed on OpenSuse Tumbleweed.

:::tip

Any bash terminal application is a nuts-aware terminal.
