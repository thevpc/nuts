title: Text Rendering & Models
---

At the heart of Nuts' text rendering capabilities lies NTF (Nuts Text Format) — a structured, styled, and composable text model.
NTF defines how text content, styles, and layout are represented, enabling you to build complex output (with colors, emphasis, alignment, structure, and more) in a way that is device-agnostic and output-agnostic.

The NText API represents these styled text blocks, and NTextStyle describes how they appear (e.g., bold, italic, success, error). Because every renderer produces NText, different outputs — from simple styled strings to complex ASCII tables or banners — can be nested, combined, and transformed consistently.

Once generated, NTF text can be rendered into multiple output formats:

- ✅ ANSI sequences – On POSIX-compatible terminals, NText is rendered as styled ANSI text. On Windows, Nuts uses Jansi to ensure the same result.
- 🌐 HTML – NText can also be rendered as HTML, enabling use in web pages or documentation. Tools like NSite (a static site generator built on Nuts/NAF) rely on this feature to transform NText blocks into HTML markup.
- 📦 Other targets – Because NTF is an abstract representation, it can be serialized to other formats or even stored as structured data for later rendering.

Building on this foundation, NTextArt offers a versatile rendering framework that converts structured data, text, and even images into expressive visual representations. It provides specialized renderers for different visualization needs:

- Text Renderers – Convert text into stylized ASCII art (e.g., figlets, banners).
- Structured Renderers – Render structured data such as tables and trees.
- Image Renderers – Transform raster images into ASCII-based art.

Because all renderers output NText (based on NTF), their results can be further styled, composed with other messages, serialized, or rendered to different backends — all while remaining portable across platforms.
