# Nuts Text Format (NTF)

The **Nuts Text Format (NTF)** is a lightweight, expressive markup language designed specifically to enhance command-line interface (CLI) output with rich, portable, and visually appealing formatting. It provides a powerful yet simple syntax that lets developers create colorful, structured, and semantically meaningful text that works seamlessly across different terminal environments and beyond.

## The Need for NTF

Traditional terminal output often relies on plain text or embedded ANSI escape codes to achieve colors and styles. This approach has several drawbacks:

- **Lack of readability:** Raw escape sequences are hard to read and maintain within source code.
- **Poor portability:** Different terminals support different levels of ANSI or control codes, leading to inconsistent rendering.
- **Limited structure:** Plain text and raw ANSI codes do not express document structure well (like lists, tables, sections).

On the other hand, existing markup languages each have their own limitations for CLI contexts:

- **HTML** is rich and flexible but too verbose and requires an HTML viewer, unsuitable for terminals.
- **Markdown** is easy to write and readable but lacks support for dynamic styling and rich terminal features.
- **Man pages (troff/groff)** provide basic terminal help formatting but are complex to author and limited in styling options.

## What Makes NTF Unique?


NTF is crafted to fill this gap by being a **terminal-first markup format** that is both **human-readable and machine-processable**, with several key advantages:

- **Readable markup:** NTF syntax uses simple inline markers for colors, font styles, lists, tables, and sections, which are easy to write and understand.
- **Rich formatting:** Supports foreground and background colors, bold/italic/underline, code blocks, bullet and numbered lists, tables, links, and other structured elements.
- **Portability:** NTF content is **independent of the terminal's escape code specifics**. Instead, it is parsed and translated to the appropriate ANSI sequences or other target formats at runtime.
- **Multi-target rendering:** Beyond ANSI terminals, NTF can be converted to **Markdown** (for documentation or developer notes) and **HTML** (for web-based manuals), ensuring a unified authoring experience.
- **Context-awareness:** NTF rendering adapts automatically to the capabilities of the target output device or session configuration, allowing graceful degradation when color or style is not supported.
- **Easy toggling:** Users can enable or disable colored output through standard Nuts options or programmatically, without affecting the underlying markup.

## NTF in Nuts Ecosystem

Within the **Nuts** toolbox, NTF plays a central role in delivering a consistent, high-quality user experience:

- **Command-line help system:** All command help, options, examples, and warnings in Nuts are authored in NTF. This allows help to be:

    - **Colorful and well-structured** on capable terminals.
    - **Plain-text friendly** when color is disabled.
    - **Automatically exportable** to Markdown or HTML for documentation portals.

- **Output formatting:** When printing messages, lists, objects, or errors, Nuts can utilize NTF to add semantic structure and emphasis, improving clarity and user comprehension.

- **Unified authoring:** Developers write output messages once in NTF and can be confident it will render correctly across all supported environments without manual adjustments.

## How NTF compares to other formats:

NTF is specifically designed for **developer-friendly, portable, terminal-first output formatting**. It bridges the gap between simple text styling (like ANSI escape codes) and more advanced document-oriented formats (like Markdown or AsciiDoctor), making it uniquely suited for CLI applications.

The table below highlights how NTF compares to other common formats across key capabilities:

| Feature                                           | **NTF**                                                       | **ANSI Escape Codes** | **Markdown**    | **AsciiDoctor** | **HTML**       |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Colored output**                                | ✅ Named colors, indexed and hex support                       | ✅ Manual, code-based | ❌ (Extensions needed) | ✅ With roles/styles | ✅ CSS/inline styles |
| **Styled text**                                   | ✅ Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough                      | ✅ Limited (manual control) | ✅ Bold, italic | ✅ Bold, italic, underline | ✅ Full style control |
| **Semantic color tags** (e.g. `error`, `warning`) | ✅ Built-in mappings (`##:red:word##`, `##:info:word##`, etc.) | ❌ None | ❌ None | ⚠️ Manual via roles | ✅ Possible via class |

| **Structured sections** (titles, subtitles)       | ✅ NTF supports semantic headers (`# Title`, `## Subtitle`)    | ❌ None | ✅ Basic headings | ✅ Full document structure | ✅ Rich document structure |
| **Lists (bullet, numbered)**                      | ❌ Not yet                                                     | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**```nuts```** comes up with a simple coloring syntax that helps writing better looking portable command line programs.
standard output is automatically configured to accept the "Nuts Text Format" (NTF) syntax. 
Though it remains possible to disable this ability using the --!color standard option (or programmatically, 
see **```nuts```** API documentation). NTF will be translated to the underlying terminal implementation using ANSI 
escape code on linux/windows terminals if available.

Here after a showcase of available NTF syntax.
