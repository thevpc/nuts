NMsg is the Nuts Application Framework (NAF) message and text formatting system. It allows you to create dynamic, flexible, 
and visually rich messages in your applications. You can use it for console output, logs, and any scenario requiring formatted text.

`NMsg` is fully integrated with `NOut` and `NErr` for displaying rich and meaningful CLI output.
