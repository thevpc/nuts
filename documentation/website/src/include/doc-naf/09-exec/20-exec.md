title: Executing External Commands
---


NAF provides a high-level API to execute external commands, whether locally or remotely, in a concise, structured, and cross-platform manner. Using NExecCmd, you can run processes, capture their output, handle errors, and even execute them on remote hosts via SSHâ€”all without the verbosity of the standard Java Process API.
**Key Features**
- Embedded & Local Execution: Run commands in the current JVM or OS environment.
- Remote Execution: Execute commands on SSH-enabled hosts transparently.
- Automatic Output Capture: Grab stdout and stderr without manually reading streams.
- Run Java Artifacts Directly: Download a JAR and its dependencies from Maven or remote repositories and execute it automatically.
- Fail-Fast Control: Stop execution immediately on errors if desired.
- Minimal Boilerplate: Avoid complex Runtime.exec() and thread-based stream consumption.


## To create a new process

```java
// Simple embedded command execution
String result = NExecCmd.of("info")
                .getGrabbedAllString();
NOut.println(result);
```

- `.of("info")` creates the command to execute.
- `.getGrabbedAllString()` captures the full output (stdout + stderr) as a string.
- No exceptions are thrown automatically; the caller can inspect result or `getResultCode()` to decide if the execution succeeded.


## Example: Executing a shell command with NSH

```java
String result = NExecCmd.of()
        .addCommand(NConstants.Ids.NSH, "-c", "ls")
        .grabAll()
        .failFast()
        .getGrabbedOutString();

NOut.println("Result:");
NOut.println(result);
```

- Nuts provides embedded shells (NSH) for running commands in a sandboxed environment.
- Output is automatically sanitized to remove terminal formatting unless explicitly requested.


## Special Executor IDs
Nuts can handle commands with special identifiers or remote resources:


```java
String result = NExecCmd.of()
        .addExecutorOptions("--bot")
        .addCommand("com.mycompany:my-remote-artifact")
        .addCommand("list", "-i")
        .getGrabbedAllString();

NOut.println(result);
```

- Useful for running workspace-bound tools or remote executables.
- Works with Maven coordinates or URLs pointing to executable jars.


## Remote & Structured Command Execution

NExecCmd is not limited to local commands: you can execute processes on remote systems via SSH (or any supported executor) and easily capture stdout/stderr with minimal boilerplate:

```java
NExecCmd u = NExecCmd.of()
        .at("ssh://me@myserver")              // Execute on remote server
        .setIn(NExecInput.ofNull())           // No stdin input
        .addCommand("ps", "-eo",             // Command + arguments
            "user,pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,tty,stat,lstart,time,command")
        .grabErr()                            // Capture stderr
        .setFailFast(true)                    // Optional: fail immediately on error
        .grabOut();                           // Capture stdout

// Access results
String stdout = u.getGrabbedOutString();
String stderr = u.getGrabbedErrString();
int exitCode = u.getResultCode();

NOut.println("Exit code: " + exitCode);
NOut.println("Output:\n" + stdout);
```

Key points:

- at(...) allows specifying a remote target (SSH, etc.).
- grabOut() / grabErr() capture output streams automatically.
- setFailFast(true) ensures that any failure will stop execution immediately.
- No need for Runtime.exec() boilerplate or manual stream handling.

This makes NExecCmd a powerful, concise, and cross-platform alternative to the traditional Java Process API.

## Why NExecCmd is Better than Runtime.exec()

Using Runtime.exec() requires verbose boilerplate to:
- manage stdin/stdout/stderr streams,
- handle threading to avoid blocking,
- wait for process completion,
- and manually check exit codes.

With NExecCmd, all of this is simplified and made cross-platform, while also supporting structured output handling, remote execution, and direct execution of downloaded Java artifacts transparently.
