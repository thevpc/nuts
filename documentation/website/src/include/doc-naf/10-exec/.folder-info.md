title: External Commands & Processes
---

Nuts provides a robust and unified API to manage external processes, execute commands, and interact with the underlying OS in a platform-independent way. This includes:

- Executing shell commands or external binaries.
- Capturing output, error streams, and exit codes.
- Filtering and manipulating running processes.
- Gracefully handling interactivity and embedded execution.
