title: Concurrency & Stability
---

In Nuts, building reliable and high-performance applications requires tools that manage shared state, caching, rate-limiting, and progress tracking safely across threads and execution contexts. The Nuts framework provides a suite of concurrency primitives and stability helpers to simplify these common challenges:
- NScopedValue<T> – Represents a thread- or context-local value that can be temporarily overridden within a scope. This allows safe modifications of variables without risking unintended side effects outside the current scope. Useful for contextual configurations or temporary overrides in multi-threaded environments.
- NCachedValue<T> – Encapsulates a lazily computed value with automatic caching. It ensures that expensive computations are performed only once, optionally refreshing based on custom invalidation rules, and is safe for concurrent access.
- NRateLimitValue<T> – Provides rate-limited access to a value or operation. It tracks usage counts over time and enforces constraints, helping prevent overuse of resources, APIs, or services in a thread-safe manner.
- NLock – A versatile locking mechanism that abstracts traditional concurrency locks. NLock can be used to synchronize access to shared resources, enforce critical sections, and implement safe multi-threaded algorithms. It also supports inter-process locking via files, enabling coordination between separate JVMs or applications.
- NProgressMonitor – Facilitates tracking and reporting of long-running tasks. It allows threads to report progress, handle cancellation, and provide estimated completion information. In addition, it supports structured progress monitoring, letting developers split tasks and assign weights to subtasks for fine-grained progress aggregation.

Together, these primitives provide a robust foundation for concurrency, caching, and stability in Nuts-based applications, ensuring that multi-threaded code behaves predictably, resources are protected, and operations are safely monitored.
