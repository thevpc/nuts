title: Nuts Application Framework
---

Nuts is much more than a package manager — it is a powerful and extensible runtime framework for Java applications. While it provides robust support for dependency resolution and artifact management compatible with Maven repositories, Nuts also delivers a comprehensive suite of libraries and services that turn it into a foundation for building modular, interactive, and automated tools.

Whether you're developing a CLI utility, a scripting engine, a DevOps automation tool, or a distributed plugin-based system, Nuts provides the scaffolding to manage dependencies, sessions, input/output, configuration, extensions, and workspace isolation — all in a portable and embeddable way.


`nuts` is a package manager that can be embedded in your application and hence present a solid Application Framework and tooling to make the applicable more robust and more portable.

`nuts` as a Framework (or Nuts Application Framework, or even simpler : `NAF`):
* Adds support for Application Lifecycle (Hooks for install, update, uninstall)
* Adds support for auto update
* Adds support for isolated input/output (via session in/out)
* Adds support for Desktop Integration
  ** Adds Shortcuts, Menus
  ** Adds Aliases
* Adds support for Base Directory API
  ** API to manage per application directories (log, cache, config,...)
* Adds support for Base Commandline API
  ** standardized commandline options
  ** inherit common options (--table, --json, ...)


## Dual Role by Design
At its core, Nuts plays two essential roles:
- As a package manager, Nuts handles runtime dependency resolution, dynamic execution of artifacts, and integration with Maven-compatible repositories.
- As a framework, Nuts offers a rich set of APIs to handle I/O, configuration, text formatting, command execution, file systems, compressed archives, and more — helping developers write cleaner, more powerful, and portable applications.

## Build, Embed, Automate

Nuts is designed to work in multiple modes of operation:
- Run Java programs and tools directly from repositories without downloading or installing them manually.
- Integrate it as a library to give your own application full access to the Nuts runtime capabilities.
- Use it as a DevOps engine to build repeatable scripts, installers, or deployment workflows.
- Use Nuts as a command-line tool to install, run, or deploy applications.
- Build your own ecosystem of versioned components, launchers, and tools powered by Nuts' modular runtime.

In short, Nuts is a full-stack developer toolbox — part package manager, part framework, part scripting engine — designed to make modern Java development more dynamic, composable, and automation-friendly.



## Whether you are:

- Building CLI tools that need versioned plugins and extensible command handling,
- Developing DevOps utilities with integrated workspace/session management,
- Creating modular applications that dynamically load artifacts at runtime,
- Writing cross-environment installers, launchers, or monitoring tools,
- Or designing educational platforms, scripting DSLs, or JVM-based OS abstractions,

Nuts delivers the foundational infrastructure so you can focus on features, not plumbing.
Key Capabilities

The NAF framework offers a wide set of features:
✅ Package & Dependency Management

- Compatible with Maven repositories and standards
- Supports local, remote, and custom repositories
- Enables runtime dependency resolution and dynamic artifact loading

✅ Configurable Workspaces & Sessions

- Isolated and shared workspace models with full lifecycle control
- Sessions encapsulate runtime configuration, user preferences, I/O handling, logging, and output styles
- Built-in support for dry-run, trace, confirmation, GUI/headless modes

✅ Structured I/O & Logging

- Supports semantic console output (NTF format) with colors, styles, and structured messages
- Unified API for stdout/stderr, input, logging, formatting, and piping
- Handles both human-friendly and machine-readable outputs (e.g., JSON, XML, Props, Tree)

✅ Filesystem & Networking Utilities

- Provides advanced file abstraction via NPath
- Built-in support for streaming, compressing, uncompressing, digesting, and manipulating file trees
- Unified access to HTTP, classpath, resources, and virtual filesystems

✅ Extensibility & Integration

- Supports modular extension points: listeners, commands, install hooks, and repositories
- Embedded scripting with support for Java source snippets and other languages
- Can be integrated into Spring, JavaFX, Swing, or any plain Java project

✅ Developer & DevOps Friendly

- Features like NRun, NExec, NShell, and NOps make it ideal for automation
- Cross-platform support: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Zero external runtime dependencies — deploy as a bare JAR, with automatic resolution on first use

## Why Use NAF?

Unlike traditional libraries or shell utilities, `NAF` brings together the flexibility of a modern scripting environment, the structure of a dependency-aware runtime, and the developer convenience of a polished CLI framework — all in one embeddable package. You can think of it as your:

- Maven-like package manager, but runtime aware
- Command-line framework, but fully pluggable
- Launcher platform, but without installation or configuration hurdles
- Shell scripting toolkit, but type-safe and Java-native

With `NAF`, the boundary between development and runtime fades away, letting you write, deploy, and evolve tools without sacrificing portability, maintainability, or developer experience.

## Lightweight, Modular, and Composable
- Modular architecture built around workspaces, sessions, and execution contexts.
- Supports multi-repository, multi-version, and multi-runtime setups.
- Helps maintain separation between application logic and environment/runtime logic — a key feature for scripting, testing, and dynamic execution.

## Not Just Tools — Ecosystems

`NAF` encourages composability: it enables you to define reusable, versioned components that can evolve independently and work across environments. It brings a new level of reusability to the Java ecosystem, bridging the gap between packaged applications, scripts, and shared libraries.
Whether you're building a command-line tool, a plugin system, a runtime launcher, or a portable enterprise toolkit — Nuts gives you a structured, scalable, and developer-friendly platform to do it all.
