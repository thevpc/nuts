title: Integration & Interoperability
---

NAF (Nuts Application Framework) is designed not only to provide powerful core utilities but also to integrate seamlessly with other Java ecosystems and frameworks. This section explores how NAF can interoperate with common tools and frameworks, allowing you to leverage its features without sacrificing compatibility or flexibility.

## Key Points

### Spring Boot Integration
NAF can be used alongside Spring Boot, providing its services (like NWorkspace, NExecCmd, NLog, and NTextArt) as beans or components in a Spring-managed application. This enables combining Spring’s dependency injection and lifecycle management with NAF’s runtime utilities.

### SLF4J Backend for NLog
While NAF provides its own logging API (NLog) with advanced features like structured logging, scopes, and message formatting, it can delegate to widely-used logging frameworks like SLF4J. This allows applications to retain NLog capabilities while integrating with existing logging infrastructure, including Logback or Log4j2.

### Flexible Output & Messaging
NAF’s components—such as NTextArt, NProgressMonitor, and NExecCmd—can output to different destinations, including standard streams, files, or logging backends. This makes it easy to integrate visual and progress feedback into GUI applications, web services, or enterprise pipelines.

### Cross-Framework Reusability
Because NAF is modular and decoupled, its APIs can coexist with other libraries without requiring significant refactoring. You can use Nuts for dependency resolution, task execution, logging, and progress monitoring in the context of Spring Boot, Micronaut, or even plain Java SE projects.
