```NCmdLine``` is a flexible and OS-portable command line parser that supports short and long options, boolean flags, valued options, non-options, comments, and argument files. It is the recommended way to handle command line input in NAF applications.

```NCmdLine``` supports command lines in the following form :

```sh
my-app -o=y --name='some name' -ex --extra value arg1 arg2
```
where the command here supports short and long options (short ones are ```-o```, ```-e``` and ```-x```, where ```-e``` and ```-x``` are combined as ```-ex```),
and of course non options or regular arguments (here ```arg1``` and ```arg2```).
Note also that ```value``` could be interpreted as a value for ```--extra``` (or not; depending on how you configure your parser, for  this option).
