##NAF## is ##non-invasive by design##: it
integrates seamlessly with existing frameworks and libraries such as
##Spring##, ##Spring Boot##,
##SLF4J##, and more, allowing you to adopt its
conventions and APIs without rewriting or restructuring your
application. Whether you're building CLI tools, desktop
applications, or services, <code>NAF</code> emphasizes clarity,
productivity, and maintainability, giving you a consistent
foundation and powerful conventions without imposing complexity or
locking you in.
