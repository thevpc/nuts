**nuts** introduces a concept very similar to java's Stream but with better extension builtin mechanisms and helper methods : ```NStream```

```NStream``` is actually a wrapper to java's Stream, Iterator and Iterable and you can create a stream using ```NStream.of(...)``` methods.

```NStream``` is extensively used in Search Command.
