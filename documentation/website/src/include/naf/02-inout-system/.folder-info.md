title: Input Output System
---

The Nuts library offers a comprehensive and flexible input/output system designed for modern CLI and application needs, including:

- `NIn`: Simplifies and unifies input handling, supporting both interactive and programmatic input sources.
- `NOut`: The standard output stream abstraction supporting colorful, structured, and formatted output that respects the current session context and output format (plain text, JSON, XML, tables, etc).
- `NErr`: Dedicated error output stream, separate from standard output, ensuring proper logging and error visibility.
- `NTrace`: Specialized output stream for trace/debug information that is only displayed when trace mode is enabled, helping users debug without cluttering normal output.
- `NLog`: A logging interface integrating with Nuts' session and workspace model to produce contextual logs with flexible verbosity and output controls.
- `NMsg`: A message abstraction enabling rich, multi-language, and parameterized messages with support for localization and structured formatting.
- `NTF`: Nuts Text Format â€” a powerful formatting system that extends standard text output with features like color, styles, and structured data rendering, allowing consistent and attractive CLI outputs.

Together, these components create a rich and developer-friendly IO system, enabling:

- Colorful and readable console output.
- Structured output formats automatically adapting to context.
- Clear separation of standard, error, and debug outputs.
- Localizable and parameterized messages.
- Simplified user input handling.

This system is integrated tightly with the Nuts session concept, meaning output behavior automatically adapts to user preferences, environment, and command-line options, making CLI tools more usable and professional.
