title: Files and Paths
---

The Nuts ecosystem provides a comprehensive set of tools designed to simplify and unify file and resource management across different protocols and formats.

What Nuts Supports

- `NPath`: A versatile path abstraction that extends beyond traditional file system paths. It supports local files, URLs (HTTP/HTTPS), classpath resources, and Maven-style artifact resources. This unified API enables seamless access and manipulation of diverse resource types.
- `NCp`: An advanced copying utility capable of copying files and directories with support for validation, progress tracking, overwrite policies, and more. It provides robust features to reliably transfer resources locally or remotely.
- `NCompress` / NUncompress: Utilities to compress and decompress files and folders using popular archive formats such as ZIP and TAR. These tools handle format detection, filtering, and extraction/compression workflows transparently.
- `NDigest`: A digest computation tool for calculating checksums and hashes (e.g., SHA-256) of files, streams, and folders. It supports integrity verification and recursive digesting to ensure file content authenticity.

Together, these components offer a flexible and powerful framework to interact with files and resources efficiently, whether for local development or distributed environments.
