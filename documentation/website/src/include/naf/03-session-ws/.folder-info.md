title: Sessions and Workspaces
---

`NWorkspace` and `NSession` are the **foundation of Nuts runtime context**. Understanding how they work is essential for correctly using all Nuts components.

## What is a `NWorkspace`?

A `NWorkspace` represents the **application context** and **component container** in Nuts. It is:

- Comparable to a Spring `ApplicationContext`,
- A container for all globally or locally scoped Nuts services (like `NOut`, `NLog`, `NWorkspaceService`, etc.),
- Required for all operations using Nuts APIs â€” at any moment, a Nuts component is always used **in the context of a workspace**.

## What is a `NSession`?

A `NSession` is a **lightweight, thread-scoped execution context** associated with a `NWorkspace`. It:

- Controls options like verbosity, trace mode, output streams, and more,
- Is **thread-local** by default and can be inherited by child threads,
- Provides runtime configuration for rendering, formatting, user input, log levels, etc.

Any Nuts operation (e.g., `NOut.println(...)`) implicitly uses the current `NSession`, and therefore accesses the `NWorkspace` bound to it.
