        Evaluates contents of current buffer as a BeanShell script,

    <para>
        This is a quick way to test a macro script even before its text
        is saved to a file.  Opening a new buffer for output is a precaution
        to prevent the macro from inadvertently erasing or overwriting
        itself. BeanShell scripts that operate on the contents of the
        current buffer will not work meaningfully when tested using this
        macro. If the script returns any value, the result of its toString()
        method is appended in a new line to the newly created buffer.
