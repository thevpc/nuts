/*
Move_Lines_Up.bsh - Beanshell macro to move a selection of lines up by one
line.  This does not handle multiple selections and will abort if there are
multiple selections. Entire lines are selected for moving, so if the selection
only includes part of a line, the entire line will be selected and moved. Note
that if the selection places the caret at the start of a line, that line will 
NOT be selected for moving. If no lines are selected, then the line containing
the caret will be moved.
