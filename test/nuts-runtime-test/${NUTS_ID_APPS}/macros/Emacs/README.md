Emacs Macros for JEdit
======================

## Introduction

This repository contains a set of key bindings and some BeanShell macros
for the popular [jEdit][] editor. The key bindings and macros, together,
attempt to provide a better emulation of the GNU Emacs editor than is
available out of the box with jEdit. Some of the key bindings in the
shortcuts file merely bind to existing jEdit macros; however, others bind
to macros provided by this package.

For more information, see the accompanying [web site][].

These macros are copyright &copy; 2005-2011 Brian M. Clapper and are
released under a BSD license.

## Notes

**NOTICE** This emulation software is not part of, or endorsed by, the GNU
Emacs project or the Free Software Foundation, nor is it a part of, or
endorsed by, the jEdit project.
