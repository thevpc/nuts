<html><body>The
<b>Folding</b>&gt;<b>Narrow to Fold</b> command hides
all lines except those in the fold containing the caret.
When editing a file with folding, this can be used to "focus" in on a block
of code and create a less cluttered display. To
display the entire buffer again, invoke the
<b>Folding</b>&gt;<b>Expand All Folds</b> command.<p>

<b>Folding</b>&gt;<b>Narrow to Selection</b> works in a similar manner,
except it hides all lines except those in the selection, rather than
those in the current fold.
