The <b>Search</b>&gt;<b>Find</b> command behaves differently when text is
selected. If the selection spans multiple lines, the
<b>Search in Selection</b> setting is selected by default. If the selection
does not contain line breaks,
the <b>Search in Current Buffer</b> setting is chosen, and the selection
is copied into the search string field.
