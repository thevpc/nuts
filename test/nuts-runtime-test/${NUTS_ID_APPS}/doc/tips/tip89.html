In jEdit 4.1, the "indent on enter" and "indent on tab"
settings were removed. Now, the behavior of the <b>ENTER</b> and <b>TAB</b> keys
can be configured in the <b>Shortcuts</b> pane of the <b>Global Options</b> dialog
box, just as with any other key. The <b>ENTER</b> key can be bound to one of
the following commands, for example:

<ul>
<li><b>Insert Newline</b>
<li><b>Insert Newline and Indent</b> (default)
</ul>

The <b>TAB</b> key can be bound to one of these commands:

<ul>
<li><b>Insert Tab</b>
<li><b>Insert Tab or Indent</b> (default)
<li><b>Indent Selected Lines</b>
</ul>

Custom behavior can also be implemented by binding these keys to
macros, etc.
