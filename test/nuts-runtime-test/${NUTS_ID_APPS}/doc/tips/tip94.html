File name globs that associate files with edit modes can be changed in
the <b>Editing</b> pane of the <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
dialog box.<p>

For example, by default files matching "*.inc" are opened in PHP mode,
but some Pascal implementations use this extension as well. If you find
yourself with an urgent need to hack some Pascal, just remove "irc" from
the PHP file name glob to get:

<pre>*.{php3,php4,php,phtml}</pre>

And add it to the Pascal file name glob:

<pre>*.{pas,dpr,dpk}</pre>
