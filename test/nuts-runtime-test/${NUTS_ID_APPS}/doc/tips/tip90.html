In jEdit 4.1, the "smart home/end" setting was removed. Now, the
behavior of the <b>HOME</b> and <b>END</b> keys can be configured in the <b>Shortcuts</b>
pane of the <b>Global Options</b> dialog box, just as with any other key. The
HOME key can be bound to one of the following commands, for example:

<ul>
<li><b>Go to Start of Line</b>
<li><b>Go to Start of White Space</b>
<li><b>Go to Start of Buffer</b>
<li><b>Smart Home</b> (default three-keystroke behavior)
</ul>

The <b>END</b> key can be bound to one of these commands:

<ul>
<li><b>Go to End of Line</b>
<li><b>Go to End of White Space</b>
<li><b>Go to End of Buffer</b>
<li><b>Smart End</b> (default three-keystroke behavior)
</ul>

There are corresponding "Select to..." commands that can be bound to
<b>S+HOME</b> and <b>S+END</b> too.
