<p> jEdit's register feature is a powerful extension of the clipboard
metaphor. From the <b>Edit - More Clipboard</b> submenu, you can see the
cut/copy/append/paste register actions. <b>C+r C+c <i>X</i></b> copies the selected text to register
<i>X</i>. <b>C+r C+v <i>X</i></b> inserts the contents of register
<i>X</i> into the buffer. Register contents are persistent between editing sessions. </p>
<p> You can see the contents of all registers in a dockable by invoking <b>View Registers</b>. </p>
