<html><body>If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can use the
wheel to scroll up and down in the text area. Various modifier keys
change the action of the wheel:

<ul>
<li><b>Shift</b> - scrolls an entire page at a time.
<li><b>Control</b> - scrolls a single line at a time.
<li><b>Alt</b> - moves the caret up and down instead of scrolling.
<li><b>Alt-Shift</b> - extends the selection up and down instead of scrolling.
</ul>
