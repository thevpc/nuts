<html><body>jEdit supports word wrap, although it is disabled by
default. You can enable it in the <b>Buffer Options</b> and
<b>Global Options</b> dialog boxes.<p>

Two wrapping modes are supported; "soft" and "hard". In the
former, text is wrapped on the fly while being displayed; in the latter,
newlines are automatically inserted into text while it is being typed.
