<html><body>If your computer has a large amount of memory, you can run
jEdit in <i>background mode</i> by passing it the
<code>-background</code> command-line switch. In background mode, jEdit
will stay running and in memory even after all views are closed. This
avoids the startup delay associated with starting jEdit multiple
times.<p>

If you also specify the <code>-nogui</code> switch, an initial view will
not be opened; so jEdit will load, but remain invisible until another
client instance is started. Using this switch, you can have jEdit loaded when
your computer starts, ready for use later on.
