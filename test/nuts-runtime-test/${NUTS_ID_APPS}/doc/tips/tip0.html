<html><body>Using abbreviations saves a lot of time, by letting you
enter long strings using a shorthand notation. To define an
abbreviation, enter the desired shorthand string and press <b>C+;</b>.
You will then be prompted for the expansion. Now, to enter the expansion
in the buffer, all you have to do is type the shorthand and press
<b>C+;</b> again.</body></html>
