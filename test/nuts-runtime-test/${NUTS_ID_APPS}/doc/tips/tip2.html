<html><body>Pressing <b>C+b</b> invokes the <guimenuitem>Complete Word</guimenuitem>
action. This action searches the current buffer and the current mode's keyword list for words beginning with
the one before the caret.<p>

<p> This serves as a very basic code completion feature, for example: </p>

<ul>
<li>When editing any kind of program source, enter the first few characters of
a previously-declared identifier name, invoke <b>C+b</b>, and save yourself
from having to type it out again.
<li>When editing Javadoc comments in Java source code,
enter "@" then press <b>C+b</b> to get a list of Javadoc tags.
<li>In a PHP file, enter a few characters and press <b>C+b</b> to see
a list of functions whose names start with what you entered.
</ul>
