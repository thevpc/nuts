If <b>quick copy</b> is enabled in
the <b>Mouse</b> pane of the <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global
Options</b> dialog box, dragging with the middle mouse button over some text
inserts that text at the previous caret position.<p>

This feature has some additional behavior you might not expect:

<ul>
<li>It can be used to transfer text between edit panes in a split view.
<li>Holding down <b>Shift</b> while clicking the middle mouse button immediately duplicates all text between the caret position and the clicked location.
<li>If there already is a selection when you start middle-dragging, the selection
will be replaced with the region you marked with the mouse.</li>
<li>Holding down <b>Control</b> while dragging the middle mouse button marks a
rectangular area, and pastes it vertically at the caret location (or into the
current selection).</li>
</ul>
