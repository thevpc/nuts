You can replace all occurrences of a specific string or regular
expression with the return value of a BeanShell script if the
<b>Return value of a BeanShell
snippet</b> radio button is selected in the search dialog box.<p>

You can use
this, for example, to replace each occurrence of <quote>Windows</quote> with
<quote>Linux</quote>, and each occurrence of <quote>Linux</quote> with
<quote>Windows</quote>, by searching for the following regular expression:<p>

<code>(Windows|Linux)</code><p>

And replacing it with the following BeanShell snippet:<p>

<code>_1.equals("Windows") ? "Linux" : "Windows"</code>
