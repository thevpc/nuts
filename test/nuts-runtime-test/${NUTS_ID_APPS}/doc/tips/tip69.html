Using the search bar can be a real time saver in a lot of cases, especially
when you need to jump around between different parts of a buffer.<p>

By default, the search bar is only shown when
one of the quick search commands are invoked; however you can specify that it
always be shown in the <b>View</b> pane of the <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global
Options</b> dialog box.<p>

The following keyboard commands deal with the search bar; you will find it
much easier to navigate around files if you memorize these:

<ul>
<li>Pressing <b>C+,</b> shows the search bar (if necessary) and sends keyboard
focus there.</li>
<li>Pressing <b>C+.</b> also shows the search bar, but pre-selects the
<b>HyperSearch</b> check box.</li>
<li>Pressing <b>A+,</b> puts the word at the caret location into the search bar.</li>
<li>Pressing <b>A+.</b> performs a HyperSearch for the word at the caret location.</li>
</ul>
