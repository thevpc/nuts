You can insert a string at a specific column on a range of lines using rectangular selections. For example, suppose you want to insert <code>static</code> in front of each of these lines:

<pre>int begin;
int end;
long balance;</pre>

Simply <b>Control</b>-drag to form a rectangular selection of zero width at the desired column, and either <b>Paste</b>, or start typing. The text will be inserted in each line at once.
