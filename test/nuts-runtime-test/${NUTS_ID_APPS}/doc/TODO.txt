TO DO

Note that this is not a current to do list. It mostly only lists bugs
and quirks that Slava wanted to fix before he stopped development. All
of these items should eventually be removed or converted into tracker
items if they are not out of date.

splitting messes up last physical line in the newly created text area

+ text area:
  - click&drag breaks fast scroll
  - format: doesn't wrap right if selection starts in the middle of the
    line
  - ruleset importing trick
  - expand fold: try to expand even if already expanded
  - backspace with virtual caret: needs tweaks
  - independent text area component
    - gutter: has a depenency on View to do focus highlight, and Marker
    - text area: depends on view for input handling,
      smart home/end macro record, showing dialog boxes, abbrevs
    - mouse handler: registers
    - text area transfer handler: opening files dependency
  - new file: explicit folding: type {{{: fold marker doesn't appear
  - finish code to hide caret on user input; enter/backspace is a problem
    maybe listen for KeyTyped instead
  - indent folding: fold marker not always updated
  - format: preserve comment chars at start
  - tabs to spaces with rect select
  - input methods
  - remove-marker, select-next/prev-marker/bracket
  - format -- instead of \n\n, what if it has \n   \n?
  - DnD still dosn't work as expected when draging from the same buffer,
  but differen text area (for example droping at the position where drag
  was started erases text)- no support for vertical pasting
  - anoying cursor blinking (responsible for this is scrolling option :
  textArea.moveCaretPosition(pos,JEditTextArea.ELECTRIC_SCROLL) in
  dragOver() method)

Ideas: a lot of the code in the jedit text area can be simplified
   for example, i'm not sure we really need the ChunkCache anymore
   just keep the chunks for the currently
   painting line around, to speed up the multiple offsetToX()
   calls that happen during painting
   also, you might want to rip out the text area's
   scrolling code, and put in a JScrollPane


+ auto indent:

  - ? : do not unindent
  - deep indent
  - Common Lisp &body forms
  - pressing enter: carry over * from prev line in javadoc
  - javadoc indent: if prev line was /* or *, unindent if prev line is
  */
  if(foo)
    while(bar)
    {
      //
    }
  <--- cursor here
  - option to disable electric keys
  - unindentThisAndFollowing
  - indent & syntax tokens

+ vfs browser:

  - test keyboard completion with expanded/collapsed tree
  - test keyboard completion with high latency VFS
  - fsb default size
  - file system browser column widths are not saved

+ misc:

  - kill ring still being reversed
  - jEdit.checkBufferStatus() fucks with split panes

  - there is a comment in browser.actions.xml:
  /* NOTE: I do NOT want plugins creating check box menu items
   * in jEdit 4.2! The API is not stable, note the _comp hack...
   * in 4.3 I will finish the full action API refactoring and
   * IS_SELECTED blocks in browser actions will have access to
   * the browser variable just like the CODE block above.
   *
   * Love, Slava */

  - option to disable buffer local properties
  - CA+PLUS +: bad
  - goToBuffer() -- if any parent has zero height or zero width...
  - deferred loading API for macro handlers
  - S+INS, etc in swing controls
  - vfs: a way of running awt requests not all at end
  - wrapped dock buttons broken

+ beanshell:

  ; after else if()
  longs not read correctly if prefixed with 0x

check tips of the day
- help:
  - titles in search are fucked
- sidebars: need a border or some sort

- C+d & killring
- plugin mgr inspection of not-loaded plugins
- history text field tweak

+ obscure:

- no need to wait for requests after newFile()
- class loading problems
- motif l&f: shortcuts in menu items
- some JLists do not auto-scroll on keystroke
- how to handle S+0-9?
- invoking action bar command twice
- backup time distance setting
- if A depends on B but A is loaded before B and B breaks, A ends up
  being loaded. Solution: load plugins in order of dependencies?

+ performance:

- 7000 line lisp file: window resize is slow
- closing lots of files is slow -- esp. with close all dialog box!
- menu drag: slow
- bracket matching: no delay for current line match??
- final optimization for OffsetManager: scan to zero or scan to end
- do buffer load AWT half immediately after work thread half
- replace all in a directory could be faster
- buffer.setMode() slow
- eliminate redundant scans and events when loading buffer
- don't repaint whole selection when resizing
- could make non-soft wrap chunk merge even faster!
- syntax SPAN::END substitution: String --> char[] --> String
- is getScreenLineOfOffset() called often?
- if caret is at the end of a buffer when doing a replace all, a lot of
  repaint() and getLineOfOffset() calls are made
- optimize for no folding & no soft wrap case:
  - reset() and changed() don't need to scan
  - scroll/physUp/Down() simpler
- inserting lines repaints whole text area
- see if getLineOfOffset() can be optimized
- optimize 1 long line case
- two repaints in line insert
- redundant calls to recalculateLastPhysicalLines()/updateScrollBars()
- redundant updateChunksUpTo() calls
