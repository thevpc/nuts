# Install Notes
To do a fresh install of nuts (if you do not have any previous version or config installed), just download nuts from and run

```
java -jar nuts-0.5.8.jar
```
After doing this, on linux platforms, you should be able to invoke nuts simply by using the 'nuts' command 
(actually installed by ndi at nuts installation time)

The verify nuts installation just type :
```
nuts version
```
you should see something like
```
0.5.8/0.5.8.0
```

# Troubleshooting

see [troubleshooting documentation](../troubleshooting.md) for more details
