 * Nuts : Network Updatable Things Service
 * (universal package manager)
 * <br>
 * is a new Open Source Package Manager to help install packages
 * and libraries for runtime execution. Nuts is the ultimate companion for
 * maven (and other build managers) as it helps installing all package
 * dependencies at runtime. Nuts is not tied to java and is a good choice
 * to share shell scripts and other 'things' . Its based on an extensible
 * architecture to help supporting a large range of sub managers / repositories.
