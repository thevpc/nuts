 * Nuts : Network Updatable Things Service
 * (universal package manager)
 * <br>
 * is a new Open Source Package Manager to help install packages and libraries
 * for runtime execution. Nuts is the ultimate companion for maven (and other
 * build managers) as it helps installing all package dependencies at runtime.
 * Nuts is not tied to java and is a good choice to share shell scripts and
 * other 'things' . Its based on an extensible architecture to help supporting a
 * large range of sub managers / repositories.
