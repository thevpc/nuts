/**
 * This package provides a comprehensive framework for working with textual data in a structured,
 * consistent, and extensible manner. It is designed to support a wide variety of use cases
 * ranging from plain text manipulation to rich, styled, and structured textual representations.
 *
 * <p>The primary goal of this package is to provide a unified abstraction for text handling,
 * formatting, and rendering, allowing applications to produce consistent output for both
 * humans and machines, across multiple output targets and data types.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Core Capabilities:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Structured Text Representation:</b> Text can be represented as a hierarchical model,
 *         supporting composite elements such as styled spans, tables, trees, lists, links, titles,
 *         and code blocks. This allows fine-grained control over presentation and manipulation.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Text Formatting:</b> Supports converting arbitrary objects or data structures into
 *         textual representations using configurable formatters and templates. This includes
 *         standard formats like JSON, XML, YAML, properties, terminal-friendly tables and trees,
 *         and custom domain-specific formats.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Text Styling and Decoration:</b> Apply styling, coloring, or other textual annotations
 *         to elements for terminal, HTML, or other visual outputs. Styles can be applied globally,
 *         per-element, or dynamically adjusted during rendering.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Rendering to Multiple Targets:</b> Render structured text to various destinations,
 *         including streams, writers, files, terminal consoles, and custom output channels.
 *         Rendering takes into account styling, formatting, and target-specific constraints.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Text Transformation:</b> Supports dynamic transformations such as filtering,
 *         reordering, aggregation, and substitution of text content. This enables flexible
 *         preprocessing or postprocessing pipelines for text outputs.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Iterable and Streamed Text:</b> Allows iteration over collections of elements with
 *         live formatting and progress reporting. This is useful for large datasets, paginated
 *         output, or interactive terminal applications.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Integration with Command-line and Interactive Environments:</b> Text outputs and
 *         formatting options can be configured via command-line arguments, interactive prompts,
 *         or runtime configuration, providing a seamless developer and user experience.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Extensibility and Customization:</b> Provides interfaces and extension points to
 *         define new text element types, formatters, renderers, and output strategies. This ensures
 *         that the framework can adapt to new domains, data types, or presentation requirements
 *         without changing the core infrastructure.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Human and Machine Readability:</b> Ensures that textual output can be both
 *         human-readable (styled, tabular, tree-like, annotated) and machine-readable
 *         (JSON, XML, TSON, YAML), allowing the same infrastructure to support logging,
 *         reporting, data exchange, and documentation generation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Overall, this package provides a robust, flexible, and consistent approach to
 * text manipulation, formatting, and rendering, forming the foundation for building
 * high-quality textual output in applications ranging from command-line tools
 * to structured data reporting and visual presentation.</p>
