/**
 * Provides a comprehensive abstraction layer for input/output operations,
 * content handling, and stream management. This package is designed to support
 * both low-level and high-level I/O workflows while maintaining consistency,
 * efficiency, and safety across different types of sources, sinks, and transports.
 *
 * <p><b>Core Responsibilities:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Stream Abstractions:</b> Unified abstractions for input and output streams,
 *         readers, and writers, supporting automatic resource management, interruption,
 *         monitoring, and adaptation between different I/O types.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Content Handling:</b> Facilities to handle structured content with metadata,
 *         digest computation, compression, uncompression, validation, and format-aware
 *         providers. Supports both file-based, in-memory, and system streams.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>File and Path Abstractions:</b> Handles file system paths, path components,
 *         permissions, types, extensions, and metadata in a consistent, platform-independent way.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Terminal Integration:</b> Abstractions for interacting with terminal devices,
 *         including modes, output streams, and adapters that unify console and programmatic I/O.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Non-blocking and Interruptible I/O:</b> Supports asynchronous, interruptible,
 *         and monitored I/O operations to facilitate responsive and robust applications.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Adapters and Utilities:</b> Helpers to bridge between different I/O paradigms,
 *         e.g., converting readers to streams, streams to writers, or providing transparent
 *         caching, buffering, and redirection.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Robust Error Handling:</b> Consistent exceptions and validation mechanisms
 *         for I/O operations, ensuring predictable behavior and recoverability in
 *         both interactive and batch scenarios.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Overall, this package forms the foundation for all I/O operations in the
 * system, providing both low-level primitives and high-level conveniences for
 * reading, writing, transforming, and monitoring data, while abstracting away
 * platform-specific differences and promoting safe, composable, and testable I/O workflows.</p>
