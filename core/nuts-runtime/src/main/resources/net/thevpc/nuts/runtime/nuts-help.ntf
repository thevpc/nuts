```sh nuts``` is a ##:_:Java™## ##:_:Package Manager## that helps discovering, downloading, assembling and executing
local and remote artifacts (packages) in a very handy way. Unlike maven which resolves dependencies at compile time,
```sh nuts``` solves dependencies at install time and, as a result, saves disk and bandwidth by downloading and caching
only libraries required for the current environment. Nuts is unique in that it reuses maven and other build tool
descriptor formats to solve dependency graph, and does not, whatsoever, have any requirement on existing
maven created packages.

Nuts stands for ##Network Updatable Things Services## tool. It is designed to support multiple package formats and even
multiple languages (platforms like dotnet and python), even-though, the current implementation supports only java.
```sh nuts``` artifacts are  stored  into repositories. A  ##:_:repository##  may be local for  storing local ```sh nuts```
or remote for accessing  remote artifacts (good examples  are  remote maven  repositories). It may
also be a proxy ##:_:repository## so that remote artifacts are fetched and cached locally to save network
resources.

One manages a set of repositories called a  ##:_:workspace## (analogous to pip 'virtualenv'). Managed packages
(artifacts) have descriptors that depict dependencies between them. This dependency is seamlessly handled by  ```sh nuts```
to resolve and download and cache on-need dependencies over the wire.

```sh nuts``` is a swiss army knife tool as it acts like (and supports) maven ##:_:build tool## to have an abstract
view of the the  artifacts ##:_:dependency## and like  zypper/apt-get/pip/npm  ##:_:package manager tools##
to ##:_:install## and ##:_:uninstall## artifacts allowing multiple versions of the very same artifact to  be installed.

Although ```sh nuts``` focuses on ##:_:Java™## artifacts, it still supports, by design, native and all non ##:_:Java™## artifacts.
Dependencies are fetched according to the current operating system type, distribution and hardware
architectures.

```sh nuts``` works either as ##:_:standalone application## or as ##:_:Java™ library## to enable dynamic and dependency
aware class loading and brings a rich toolset to provide a versatile portable command line tools such
as ###nsh### (a bash like shell), ###tomcat###, ###derby### ... wrapper tools to make it easier providing
##:_:development## , ##:_:test## and ##:_:deployment## reproducible environments.

With container concepts in mind, ```sh nuts``` is the perfect ##:_:Java™## application tool for Docker, CoreOs
and other ##:_:container engines##.

##) COMMON VERBS:
install,uninstall,update : install/uninstall/update an artifact (using its fetched/deployed installer)
fetch,push               : download, upload to remote repositories
search                   : search for existing/installable artifacts
exec                     : execute an artifact (tool)
deploy, undeploy         : manage artifacts on the local repositories

##) SYNOPSIS:
```sh
nuts [<-options>]... <command> <args> ...
```

##) VERSIONS:
Boot API     Version: ###${nuts.workspace-boot.version}###
Boot Runtime Version: ###${nuts.workspace-runtime.version}###
##:_:Java™##        Version: ###${java.version} (${java.vm.name})###

##) NUTS OPTIONS:
 There are four (4) types of options : 
 * ##:_:create options##
 * ##:_:create exported options##
 * ##:_:open options##
 * ##:_:open exported options##

 ##:_:create options## are considered solely when creating a new workspace. They will be persisted then (to the configuration file)
                    but they will be ignored elsewhere if the workspace already exists : configured parameters will be in use.

 ##:_:create exported options## are considered both when creating a new workspace and when running it. If they are specified in creation
                    they will be persisted. If they are specified later they will override persisted values without persisting the changes

 ##:_:open options## are transient (non persistent) options that will override any configured value (if any) and will be
                     in use in the current process (and ignored elsewhere). Such options will be considered in creating workspaces
                     as well but still they are not persistent.

 ##:_:open exported options## are open (so transient, non persistent) options that will override any configured value (if any)
                      having the ability to be exported to any ##:_:Java™## child process (as system property ```sh -D```...)


###) NUTS CREATE EXPORTED OPTIONS:
 ```sh --workspace <workspace-location> ``` (default is ```kw ""``` ad is equivalent to ```kw "default-workspace"```)
 ```sh -w <workspace-location> ```
      workspace location to open (or create).
      this defaults to default-workspace. Typically this refers to ~/.config/nuts/default-workspace on *NIX Platforms*
      (when ```sh --system-conf-home``` is not specified). workspace location contains mainly config information.

 ```sh --user      <username> ``` (default is ```kw ""```)
 ```sh -u          <username> ```
      workspace username.
      if not specified, all access to ```sh nuts``` will be with anonymous identity. so to promote user privileges, one may
      specify user credentials (see ```sh --password ```)

 ```sh --password  <password> ``` (default is ```kw ""```)
 ```sh -p  <password> ```
      workspace password.
      They must be provided when ```sh --user``` is present.

 ```sh -V <boot-api-version> ``` (default is ```kw ""``` and points to the currently loaded api version)
 ```sh --boot-version <boot-api-version> ```
 ```sh --boot-api-version <boot-api-version> ```
      run a new/different instance of ```sh nuts``` with the specified version
 ```sh --sandbox=true|false ``` (default is ```kw false``` )
      when creating the workspace, generate a random workspace, for testing purposes.
      sandbox mode will be propagated/exported as ```kw --confined```
 ```sh --confined=true|false ``` (default is ```kw false``` )
      use a confined workspace that does not allow user wide or system wide alteration
 ```sh --isolation=system|user|confined|sandbox ``` (default is ```kw system``` )
      use the level of isolation for the workspace

 ```sh --boot-runtime <runtime-id-or-version> ``` (default is ```kw ""``` and points to the latest compatible nuts-runtime artifact)
      load runtime (nuts-runtime) version. either version may be expressed or full nuts implementation
      (other than nuts-runtime) should be defined

 ```sh --java      <java-command> ``` (default is ```kw ""``` and points to the currently loaded JVM executable)
 ```sh --boot-java <java-command> ```
 ```sh -j <java-command> ```
      ##:_:Java™## command to run new instance of ```sh nuts```

 ```sh --java-home      <java-home> ```   (default is ```kw ""``` and points to the currently loaded JVM)
 ```sh --boot-java-home <java-home> ```
 ```sh -J <java-home> ```   (default is ```kw ""```)
      ##:_:Java™## home to run new instance of ```sh nuts```. When ##:_:Java™## command is present, this will be ignored.

 ```sh --java-options      <java-options> ```  (default is ```kw ""```)
 ```sh --boot-java-options  <java-options> ```
 ```sh -J <java-options> ```
      ##:_:Java™## options to run new instance of nuts

###) NUTS CREATE OPTIONS:

 ```sh --archetype <archetype-name>``` (default is ```kw "default"```)
 ```sh -A <archetype-name>```
      workspace archetype to create (if workspace not found).
      when opening a non existing workspace, ```sh nuts``` will create it
      using the default archetype. Supported archetypes are :
          ```kw default``` : should handle most cases. Will create 6 repositories
                    ```kw local```            : containing local ```sh nuts``` (java and non java ```sh nuts```).
                    ```kw maven-local```      : referencing ```path ~/.m2/repository``` local maven repository.
                    ```kw maven-central```    : referencing ```path https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/``` (with cache support).
                    ```kw system```           : referencing global (root, system wide) repository if available.
                    This list can be altered using ```sh --repos``` options, using ```sep =```, ```sep +``` and ```sep -``` modifiers.
                    When you use ```sh --repos=+spring```, or simply ```sh --repos=spring``` the spring repos will be appended to this list
                    When you use ```sh --repos=-maven-central,system```, you will disable both maven-central and system
                    When you use ```sh --repos==maven-central```, this list is totally replaced by 'maven-central'
          ```kw minimal``` : will create an almost empty workspace with a single ```sh nuts``` local repository and no users.
                        You should use it in conjunction with ```sh --boot-repos``` options to enable a valid location from.
                        This list is not altered using "--repos" options, using '=', '+' and '-' modifiers.
                        which nuts would be downloaded as well.
          ```kw server```  : will create an almost empty workspace with a single ```sh nuts``` local repository
                        and a couple of users ##:_:guest## (read support) and ##:_:contributor## (write support).
                        You should use it in conjunction with ```sh --boot-repos``` options to enable a valid location from
                                                which nuts would be downloaded as well.

 ```sh --store-strategy <store-strategy>``` (default is ```kw "exploded"``` for names and ```kw "standalone"``` for paths)
      Define store strategy used for persisting configuration and data of the workspace.
      Valid values of <store-strategy> are ```kw exploded```, ```kw standalone```.
      ```kw exploded```   : use distinct folders for temp, var, lib, config ... folders (this is the default)
      ```kw standalone``` : use a self contained folder for all types of data of the workspace. This is interesting for sharing
                   workspaces across multiple machines.
      If the workspace location (in  ```sh --workspace``` option) is a simple name (without '/'), the store strategy
      defaults to ```kw exploded```. In all other cases, it defaults to ```kw standalone```

 ```sh -S```
 ```sh --standalone``` (default is true for path based workspaces)
       will boot with standalone strategy so that all files will be stored in the workspace folder
       overriding workspace config. same as  ```sh --store-strategy``` ```kw standalone```
 
 ```sh --exploded-workspace```  (default is true for name based workspaces)
       will boot with exploded strategy so that all file will be stored distinct folders (cache, and log)
       particularly will be stored elsewhere depending on on configuration.
       same as  ```sh --store-strategy``` ```kw exploded```

 ```sh --repo-store-strategy <store-strategy>``` (default is exploded for name based workspaces)
      Defines store strategy used for persisting config and data of the repositories.
      Valid values of <store-strategy> are ```kw exploded```, ```kw standalone```.
      ```kw exploded```   : use distinct folders for temp, var, lib, config ... folders (this is the default)
      ```kw standalone``` : use a self contained folder for all types of data of the repository (under repository's main folder).
                   This is interesting for sharing workspaces across multiple machines.

 ```sh --standalone-repositories``` (default false)
       for newly created repos, will boot with standalone strategy so that all file will be stored in the repository's folder
       overriding workspace config. same as  ```sh --repo-store-strategy standalone```
 
 ```sh --exploded-repositories``` (default true)
       for newly created repos, boot with exploded strategy so that all file will be stored distinct folders (cache, and log)
       particularly will be stored elsewhere depending on on configuration.
       same as  ```sh --repo-store-strategy exploded``` (this is default)

 ```sh --standalone``` (default false if the workspace location is a simple name, and true if not)
    Equivalent of ```sh --standalone-workspace```

 ```sh --exploded```  (default true if the workspace location is a simple name, and false if not)
    Equivalent of ```sh --exploded-workspace```

 ```sh --store-layout <store-layout>```  (default use system layout)
      Defines store layout relatively to the running operating system. This resolves root locations of data folders.
      That is to say that all 'config' folders for instance will be located at the location defined by the layout.

      Valid values of <store-layout> are ```kw system```, ```kw windows```, ```kw linux```, ```kw macos``` and ```kw unix```
      ```kw system```     : resolve the running operating system (windows, linux, ...) and select appropriate folder
      ```kw windows```    : always use windows layout (even if running on iOS)
      ```kw linux```      : always use linux layout (even if running on windows)
      ```kw unix```       : always use linux/unix layout (even if running on windows)
      ```kw macos```      : always use macos layout (even if running on windows)

      Data folders of nuts are :
        apps     : executable binaries folder. Equivalent to linux's '/bin' folder. It is defined as
                        "base directory relative to which reusable executable applications and scripts should be written"
        lib      : non executable binaries (libraries) folder. Equivalent to linux's '/usr/lib' folder. It is defined as
                        "base directory relative to which reusable libraries should be written"
        config   : configuration/settings files folder. equivalent to XDG spec's XDG_CONFIG_HOME folder defined as
                        "base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be written"
        var      : data files folder. More or less related to XDG spec's XDG_DATA_HOME folder. It is defined as
                        "the base directory relative to which user-specific non executable data files should be stored"
        log      : log/trace files folder. Equivalent to XDG_LOG_HOME a non standard XDG variable defined as
                        "the base directory relative to which application non-essential data for trace and monitoring
                        should be stored"
        temp     : temporary files folder. Equivalent to user/system temp folder defined as
                        "the base directory relative to which application temporary data should be stored"
        cache    : cache folder. Equivalent to XDG spec's XDG_CACHE_HOME folder defined as
                        "the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential data files should be stored"
        run      : run folder. Equivalent to to XDG spec's XDG_RUNTIME_HOME bin folder defined as
                        "the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential runtime files and other
                        file objects (such as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored"

     In the Windows layout, default (home) locations resolve to ($HOME is the user's home folder)
        apps     : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/apps"```
        lib      : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/lib"```
        config   : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/config"```
        var      : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/var"```
        log      : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Roaming/nuts/log"```
        temp     : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/temp"```
        cache    : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/cache"```
        run      : ```sh "$HOME/AppData/Local/nuts/run"```

     In the Linux/Unix/MacOS layout, default locations resolve (according to XDG Base Directory Specification) 
     to ($HOME is the user's home folder)
        config   : ```sh "$HOME/.config/nuts"```
        apps     : ```sh "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/apps"```
        lib      : ```sh "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/lib"```
        var      : ```sh "$HOME/.local/share/nuts/var"```
        log      : ```sh "$HOME/.local/log/nuts"```
        cache    : ```sh "$HOME/.cache/nuts"```
        temp     : ```sh "$java.io.tmpdir/$username/nuts"```
        run      : ```sh "/run/user/$USER_ID/nuts"```
     
    These home locations are tuned individually using the following options
            ```sh --system-bin-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-lib-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-conf-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-var-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-log-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-temp-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-cache-home <path>```
            ```sh --system-run-home <path>```

            ```sh --<os-family>-bin-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-lib-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-conf-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-var-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-log-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-temp-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-cache-home <path>```
            ```sh --<os-family>-run-home <path>```

            where <os-family> in one of ```kw windows```, ```kw linux```, ```kw unix```, ```kw macos``` or ```kw system```.
            This helps moving workspace folder from/to distinct os families while providing a centralized configuration.
            when using ```kw system``` OS family, the effective OS family will be detected at runtime.

 ```sh --system-layout``` or --system``` (default behaviour)
       will use current system layout to resolve folder candidates for log,config,apps ....
       same as  ```sh --store-layout``` <store-layout> system```
 
 ```sh --windows-layout``` (default is true on windows systems)
       will use windows layout to resolve folder candidates for log,config,apps ....
       same as  ```sh --store-layout <store-layout> windows```

 ```sh --linux-layout```  (default is true on linux systems)
       will use linux/unix layout to resolve folder candidates for log,config,apps ....
       same as  ```sh --store-layout <store-layout> linux```

 More tuning of these folders may be done by defining the folders location directly 
 instead of the folder's home locations using the following options :
            ```sh --bin-location <path>```
            ```sh --lib-location <path>```
            ```sh --config-location <path>```
            ```sh --var-location <path>```
            ```sh --log-location <path>```
            ```sh --temp-location <path>```
            ```sh --cache-location <path>```
            ```sh --run-location <path>```

 ```sh --install-companions or -k ```  (default is false)
       install companion tools.
 
 ```sh --switch ``` (default is ```kw false```)
      When creating a new workspace, by default, only default workspace (```sh --workspace=""```) updates ```path .bashrc``` file
      (or equivalent, according to the current installed and used shell) to point to that workspace. So that, when you
      type ```sh nuts``` it is that workspace that is used. You can change choose to "switch" the binding to the currently
      created workspace by arming this flag.

 ```sh --init-scripts ``` (default is ```kw true``` for default archetype)
      When creating a new workspace, you can select to enable or disable creation of os shell scripts to point to nuts
      and other installed artifacts using ```sh --!init-scripts ``` flag.

 ```sh --init-launchers ``` (default is ```kw true``` for default archetype)
      When creating a new workspace, you can select to enable or disable creation of menus and desktop icons by using
      ```sh --!init-launchers ``` flag. This option implies ```sh --init-scripts ```

 ```sh --init-java ``` (default is ```kw true``` for default archetype)
      When creating a new workspace, you can select to enable or disable registration of installed JDK/JRE in the system
      by using ```sh --!init-java ``` flag. This option implies ```sh --init-scripts ```

 ```sh --init-platforms ``` (default is ```kw true``` for default archetype)
      When creating a new workspace, you can select to enable or disable registration of installed platforms (including
      java) in the system by using ```sh --!init-platforms ``` flag. This option implies ```sh --init-java ```

 ```sh --verbose , --log-verbose  , --log-finest  , --log-info , --log-fine ,
 --log-finer , --log-severe , --log-warning , --log-config ,
 --log-off , --log-off ```
      apply logging level to both terminal and file

 ```sh --log-term-verbose  , --log-term-finest  , --log-term-info , --log-term-fine ,
 --log-term-finer , --log-term-severe , --log-term-warning , --log-term-config ,
 --log-term-off , --log-term-off```
      apply logging level to terminal

 ```sh --log-file-verbose  , --log-file-finest  , --log-file-info , --log-file-fine ,
 --log-file-finer , --log-file-severe , --log-file-warning , --log-file-config ,
 --log-file-off , --log-file-off```
      apply logging level to terminal

 ```sh --log-file-size       <size>```
      define the maximum number of mega to write to any one file. size is either expressed in mega or suffixed with unit.
      supported units are :
        ```kw k``` or ```kw kb``` : for kilo-bytes (example 1024k)
        ```kw m``` or ```kw mb``` : for mega-bytes (example 10m)
        ```kw g``` or ```kw gb``` : for giga-bytes (example 10Gb)
      The size is always a multiple of Mb

 ```sh --log-file-base     <log-folder-path>```
      define log file folder path

 ```sh --log-file-name       <log-file-name-pattern>```
      define log file name pattern. this defaults to "nuts-%g.log"

 ```sh --log-file-count      <number>```
      define the number of files to use (in rotating log)

 ```sh --log-inherited```
      calls rootLogger.setUseParentHandlers(true) to inherit log handlers.

 ```sh --exclude-extension     <extension-id-list>```
      exclude extensions from being loaded at runtime. list is separated with characters " ,;"

 ```sh --exclude-repository   <repository-list>```
      exclude repositories from being loaded at runtime. list is separated with characters " ,;"

 ```sh -r <repository-path>```
 ```sh --repository   <repository-path>```
 ```sh --repositories <repository-path>```
 ```sh --repos        <repository-path>```
      register one or multiple (comma ',' separated) temporary repositories at the given path
      repositories follow the following pattern
      [+-=]?(<name>=)?(<repo-type>[+]@)?<path>
      some examples are:
      ```sh --repos=+jcenter ```
      ```sh --repos=-https://jcenter.bintray.com ```
      ```sh --repos=jcenter=https://jcenter.bintray.com ```
      ```sh --repos=jcenter=maven@https://jcenter.bintray.com ```
      ```sh --repos==dev=maven@htmlfs:https://maven.thevpc.net ```

      the prefix operator (+,-,=) when specified defines whether the repository is
        to include (+), to exclude (-) or to replace (=) ie all existing repositories will be
        discarded and replaced with the given list of repositories.
      This list will be used when creating a new workspace. In that conditions, the list may affects the 'archetype' considered.
      For example, the default repositories in "default" archetype are 'local,maven-local,maven-central,system'.
          "--repos=+jcenter" produces a final repository list of 'local,maven-local,maven-central,system,jcenter'
          "--repos=jcenter"  also produces a final repository list of 'local,maven-local,maven-central,system,jcenter'
          "--repos=-system"  produces a final repository list of 'local,maven-local,maven-central'
          "--repos==system"  produces a final repository list of 'system'
      The repository names supported are
                    ```kw local```          : local user nuts folder repository
                    ```kw system```         : local user nuts folder repository
                    ```kw .m2```

                    ```kw atlassian-snapshot``` :
                                              maven repository at ```path https://packages.atlassian.com/maven/public-snapshot```
                    ```kw oracle```         : maven repository at ```path https://maven.oracle.com```
                    ```kw google```         : maven repository at ```path https://maven.google.com```
                    ```kw spring```
                    ```kw spring-framework```
                                            : maven repository at ```path https://repo.spring.io/release```
                    ```kw maven-thevpc-git```
                    ```kw vpc-public-maven```
                                            : maven repository at ```path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thevpc/vpc-public-maven/master```
                    ```kw nuts-thevpc-git```
                    ```kw vpc-public-nuts```
                                            : maven repository at ```path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thevpc/vpc-public-nuts/master```
                    ```kw dev```
                    ```kw thevpc```         : maven repository at ```path https://maven.thevpc.net```
      The repository types supported are:
                    ```kw maven```          standard maven repository
                    ```kw nuts```           standard nuts repository
      The supported protocols are:
                    ```kw http```  ```kw https``` for http(s) server access, most likely such repositories are not navigable. i.e, you
                                            can download an artificat if and only you know its full coordinates
                    ```kw htmlfs```         for http(s) server access that is navigable by 'scrapping' its html content.
                                            At boot time, only standard 'Tomcat Http Server' standard directory servlet is supported.
                                            later on, all nuts filesystem protocols (implemented in NPath) including ```kw http```,
                                            ```kw https```, ```kw htmlfs``` (that supports tomcat and httpd/apache directory listing),
                                            ```kw dotfilefs```, ```kw ssh``` and ```kw githubfs``` are supported.
                                            Remember that boot time repos are only used for installing ```sh nuts``` itself (and its
                                            dependencies).

 ```sh --yes | -y | --force```
      disables interactive mode and assumes ```kw yes``` for all questions

 ```sh --no | -n```
      disables interactive mode and assumes ```kw no``` for all questions

 ```sh --ask```
      enables interactive mode

 ```sh --error```
      exit with error whenever interactive mode is required


```sh --desktop-launcher=never|unsupported|supported|preferred|always```  (default depends on the operating system and the availability of a desktop environment)
   this option overrides default behaviour of the system
   desktop environment. It defines the support mode for desktop icons (application shortcut on the Desktop) for the desktop
   environment ( ##@see## NutsSupportMode class).
   ```sh ---system-desktop-launcher=unsupported``` disables creating any desktop icon on the system
   ```sh ---system-desktop-launcher=supported```   enables creating desktop icons whenever asked by an application
   ```sh ---system-desktop-launcher=preferred```   enables creating desktop icons whenever asked by an application and
                                                   that application requires this preference

```sh ---menu-launcher=never|unsupported|supported|preferred|always``` (default depends on the operating system and the availability of a desktop environment)
   this option overrides default behaviour of the system desktop environment.
   It defines the support mode for creating a menu for the desktop environment.

```sh ---user-launcher=never|unsupported|supported|preferred|always``` (default depends on the operating system and the availability of a desktop environment)
   this option overrides default behaviour of the system desktop environment.
   It defines the support mode for creating a custom application shortcut for the desktop environment.

 ###) NUTS OPEN OPTIONS:

 ```sh --recover  or -z``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      try to recover from invalid workspace by ignoring cache and re-resolving dependencies. User configuration will not be altered.
      Will bootstrap workspace unless ```sh -Q``` (```sh --skip-boot```) option is armed.

 ```sh --reset  or -Z``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      reset (delete) ```sh nuts``` workspace folder before starting the workspace. All user configuration will not be deleted.

 ```sh --hard-reset``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      hard reset (delete) all of ```sh nuts``` workspaces and any configuration file. All user configuration will not be deleted.
      a common usage is to hard-reset nuts and exit using ```sh -Qy --hard-reset``` which will silently hard-reset configuration and exit.
      if ```sh -Q``` is not used, after resetting, a new workspace will be bootstrapping

 ```sh --skip-boot  or -Q``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      do not load workspace. This is helpful when used with ```sh --reset  or -Z```, aka ```sh -QZ```,  in which case,
      ```sh nuts``` is completely uninstalled from your system (called ```warn kill mode```).

 ```sh --dry  or -D``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      perform a dry execution (with no side effects) rather than an effective one. prints actions or external command lines to
      perform if the ```sh --dry``` was not armed. Useful to know more about command effects.

 ```sh --skip-welcome  or -K``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      do not call welcome command if the command line is empty. This is helpful in conjunction with ```sh --reset``` not
      to start a new workspace (and recreate config files) after resetting the configuration folders.

 ```sh --embedded  or -b``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      when invoking a nuts artifact, it will be executed in the current process (no JVM process wil be spawn)

 ```sh --external  or --spawn or -x``` (defaults to ```bool true```)
      when invoking a nuts artifact, it will always be executed in a newly created process (this is the default)

 ```sh --system``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
 ```sh --user-cmd``` (deprecated, replaced by --system)
      the command is considered as a native command (not a nuts) and will be passed to the os as is.

 ```sh --current-user``` (defaults to ```bool true```)
      the command is run as current user (default)

 ```sh --as-root```   (defaults to ```bool false```)
 ```sh --root-cmd``` (deprecated, replaced by --as-root)
      the command need to run with elevated privileges, aka as root (a password will be asked for if not already root).

 ```sh --run-as <user-login>```  (defaults to ```string ""```)
      the command need to run with impersonation, aka as user <user-login> (a password will be asked for if not already <user-login>).

 ```sh --open-mode  <mode>```  (defaults to ```kw rw```)
      defines open mode of the workspace. three values are accepted :
      ```kw open-or-create``` or ```kw rw``` or ```kw on``` or ```kw oc``` :
                    this is the default, if the workspace exists, it will be opened ;
                    if it is not it will be created then opened.
      ```kw open-existing``` or ```kw r```   or ```kw o``` :
                    will open existing workspace of fail
      ```kw create-new``` or ```kw w``` or ```kw c``` or ```kw n``` :
                    will create non existing workspace of fail

 ```sh --open``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      will open existing workspace or fail if not already existing

 ```sh --create``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      will create non existing workspace or fail if already existing

 ```sh --open-or-create``` (defaults to ```bool true```)
      will create non existing workspace or open if already existing

 ```sh --open-or-null``` (defaults to ```bool false```)
      will open existing workspace or exit not already existing

 ```sh --theme <theme-name>``` (defaults to ```kw default```)
      start nuts using a specific terminal coloring theme.
      Current themes include:
        - ##default## use default theme for the current environment
        - ##ansi##    use ANSI colors
        - ##horizon## used as default on linux and other NIX
        - ##grass##   used as default on windows
        - any file path or url   : define your customized theme

```sh ---debug=port,(suspend|!suspend)``` this option enables running child processes with debug mode.
   It defaults to ```string "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005" ```
   Hence it runs by default in server mode, and using socket transport. If the port is not defined, it defaults to ```number 5005```.
   It the suspend mode is not defined it defaults to ```boolean true```.
   If this option is encountered as the very first argument, the root jvm process is also run in debug mode.
   ```sh nuts``` wil  use the first port available starting from the given port number.

###) NUTS NON STANDARD OPTIONS:

```sh nuts``` provides extra, non standards options (aka susceptible to change in later versions).
Non standard options can be used by ```sh nuts``` or any ```sh nuts``` application. Such options start with three dashes
(and not two dashes).

```sh ---show-command``` prints child process command arguments
```sh ---monitor-start``` prints a message when starting a new monitor


###) SPECIAL OPTIONS:
```sh --version  [<-options>]...```
 or ```sh -version``` or ```sh -v```

      for more details, type : ```sh nuts version``` version

 ```sh --help  [<-options>]...```
 or ```sh -help``` or ```sh -h```
      show a short message describing nuts and exit without loading the workspace
      for more details, type : ```sh nuts help```

##) NUTS COMMAND:
```sh nuts``` handles a set of command to manage nuts it sel and to run/exec other programs, mainly those its was responsible
for installing. Commands support include internal commands, supported packages (installed or not, when not installed
will search for it), aliases (a commodity mechanism to extend internal commands) and even any other executable.
 Here is a lis of internal commands :

 ```sh version  [<-options>]...```
      load workspace and show api and runtime versions, then exit

      check if a newer version of ```sh nuts``` or any of the provided <id>
      is available in the current workspace and perform update by downloading (fetch)
      and installing the artifact. The updated version is promoted to 'default' version.
      for more details, type : ```sh nuts``` help update
            
 ```sh check-updates [<-options>]... <id> ...```
      check if a newer version of ```sh nuts``` is available in the current workspace without performing updates
      Takes the same arguments and options as ```sh update``` command
      for more details, type : ```sh nuts``` help check-updates

 ```sh search [<-options>]... <id> ...```

 ```sh --exec [<-options>]... [command] <args>...```
 ```sh -e [<-options>]... [command] <args>...```
      run command with the given executor options ( it will be considered an option if it
      starts with ```sh -``` ). This is helpful to issue JVM Options to executor for instance.
      for more details, type : ```sh nuts``` help exec

 ```sh which [<-options>]... [command] ...```
      show command to be executed if run with 'exec' 
      for more details, type : ```sh nuts``` help which
            
 ```sh - <command>...```
   run a nuts shell ```sh nsh``` command with the remaining arguments.
   This is equivalent to ```sh nsh -c <command>```

```!include classpath:/net/thevpc/nuts/runtime/includes/standard-options-format.ntf```

##) EXAMPLES:
```sh nuts help```
            show this help and exit
       
```sh nuts help exec```
            show help for the exec command, equivalent to ```sh nuts exec --help```

```sh nuts --workspace /home/me/some-folder --archetype=minimal ```
            a minimal (####minimal#### archetype) workspace will be created
            and saved if no workspace was resolved. The workspace handles local 
            packages only
       
```sh nuts --workspace /home/me/some-folder  update ```
            updates ```sh nuts``` to the very latest version using workspace location
            /home/me/some-folder.

```sh
        nuts --workspace /home/me/some-folder  --yes -e -Xmx1G netbeans-launcher
```
            run netbeans-launcher with JVM option ```sh -Xmx1G```. If the artifact is not installed
            it will be automatically installed ( ```sh --yes``` modifier helps disabling interactive mode)

```sh
nuts -Zy -w test -P=%n
```
            force progress to use newline after each message instead of updating the same line while using test workspace

```sh
nuts -ZSby ---system-desktop-launcher=preferred
```
            run nuts and prefer creating launcher icons when asked for by apps regardless of system defaults.

```sh
nuts -ZQ -w=test --json
```
            reset workspace test and show result in json format

```sh
nuts -ZySb -w=test --theme=documentation/website/static/theme-examples/min2.ntf-theme
```
            run nuts with a custom theme file.
            Examples of theme files are available under ```sh $nuts_github/website/static/theme-examples/```


```sh
nuts - ls
```
            run the ls command using nsh (aka ```sh nuts nsh -c ls```)

```sh
nuts ls
```
            run the ls command (either defined as a custom command or system command).
            Note that installing nsh will also install somme custom commands, including ```sh ls```
            which refers to ```nsh nsh -c ls```, too

###) special command native-exec
Nuts Boot can be used to run native commands by using native-exec as very first argument.
native-exec allows running any command until it exits without error (zero status) or a maximum run count is reached

```sh
nuts native-exec <options>... <command>...
```

 ```sh --min-time=<time>``` (defaults to ```period 0ms```)
      if the running command exits before ```min-time```, the application ends with error
      time can be suffixed with 'ms' (for milliseconds) or 's' for seconds

 ```sh --wait-time=<time>``` (defaults to ```period 0ms```)
      time to wait before rerunning the same command
      time can be suffixed with 'ms' (for milliseconds) or 's' for seconds


 ```sh --max-count=<time>``` (defaults to ```int 1```)
      if the running command exits before ```min-time```, the application ends with error
      time can be suffixed with 'ms' (for milliseconds) or 's' for seconds
